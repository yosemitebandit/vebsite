Lots of interesting articles about the validity of the recent "Nefertiti Hack" --
an alleged "heist" of the bust of Nefertiti on display in Neues Museum Berlin.

<!--more-->

Two artists recently put a very detailed 3D model of the bust online,
and they claim it came from a scan they made with a Kinect hidden beneath a scarf.
Others now claim that the scan could not have come from a Kinect,
and this may be a coverup for a true digital heist of the 3D model from the museum's servers,
or a sympathetic party within the museum gifting the model to the artists.

Very elaborate!  See [here](http://www.amarna3d.com/nefertiti-hack-questions-regarding-the-3d-scan-of-the-bust-of-nefertiti/)
