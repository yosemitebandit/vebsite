Fast becoming a personal hero, [this video](http://www.pbs.org/video/1812020808/)
was a nice biography of Mr. Muir.

<!--more-->

Muir was a talented machinist and inventor during his early life in Wisconsin.
His father was a Calvinist and brought the family over from Ireland.
Muir worked in a shop until an accident injured (or cost him?) his right eye.
Then he began a walk South, eventually reaching Florida.
Somewhere around Georgia he was laid low by Malaria. This eventually sent him west to SF.

He corresponded with Emerson.. I wonder if he met Thoreau?
Muir apparently was one of the first (or maybe <i>the</i> first)
to hypothesize that the Yosemite Valley was carved up by glacial floes.

I’d like to know more about this relationship:

> Muir disapproved of and even feared native Indians he met in the mountains of Northern California..

From his time in Alaska, part of a journal perhaps:

> One learns that the world, though made, is yet being made.

At around 40 he slowed his wanderings to Alaska and the wilder parts of CA.
He married and took up his wife’s family’s orchards.
It’s not clear - did he ever leave the country (apart from his early boat ride to New York)?

On teaching the names of plants to his daughters,

> How would you like it if someone didn’t call you by your name.
