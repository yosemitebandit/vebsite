- with the power of Euler's formula (1740)
- but Cotes had `log(cos x + isin x) = ix` in 1714, why do we focus on Euler's form?
- ah, [StackExchange explains](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/1315733/difference-between-the-formula-of-roger-cotes-and-euler),
this complex log was correct at the time but is no more!

- I'm learning about mini-splits
- TOH install: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bMb-K_baOI

multiple outdoor units with an air handler, a variety of vents and several wall-mount units
