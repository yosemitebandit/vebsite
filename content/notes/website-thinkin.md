..I'd hate for this sidebar site to be my main thing --
it'd be fun to be more creative

like what about a generative site..
you scroll down and roots continue being created in the side/background.
and you can browse back into old projects.
maybe you have to hack them away to actually read the site.
generative flowers and animals on the notes site
or like animated ascii art.

like this awesome demo from [nick kwiatek](http://nkwiatek.com/experiments/ascii#)
or something colorful ala [substack](substack.net)

or maybe the projects page scrolls horizontally,
everybody loves stuff like that :|
something a bit less prosaic and predictable,
I mean, that's ok for the blog stuff,
but the projects section should be fun..

on urls, what a wonderful timesink..
[this site](http://www.manythings.org/vocabulary/lists/l/words.php?f=noll06)
helped me find some interesting words for mashing together.
for instance, "pinewire" and "oakmachine" were available, and they sound nice.
