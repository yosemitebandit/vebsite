Me and Mona went to Belize in the spring of 2014,
we started inland, heading to San Ignacio.
There are some amazing archaelogical sites and great food -- these are salbutes.

Then we visited Placencia and Hopkins, snorkeling a bit in Laughing Bird Caye.
I got to try hudut -- a Garifuna fish stew, prettttty tasty!
