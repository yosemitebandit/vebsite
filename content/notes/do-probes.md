* developed first portable DO probe in 1963 -- a membrane-covered Clark Polarographic sensor
* optical sensors are also available (may also be called luminescent DO or rugged DO sensors) --
still uses Clark's membrane-covered system


### [OTTHydromet video on Clark cell calibration](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qFiTePlx-a8)

* probes have two electrodes surrounded by an electrolyte solution
and covered by an oxygen-permeable membrane
* O2 crossing the membrane is consumed in a chemical reaction
and causes a change in current flow between the electrodes
* since O2 is consumed, the water around the sensor must be replaced by natural flow or a circulator
