- this is a really impressive text-to-image package
- out of the box I think it's just
llama3 expanding / adding nuance to your original prompts
and then using stable diffusion,
specifically the default model as of now is `juggernautXL_v8Rundiffusion`
- I've played with Midjourney for a while and Fooocus gives really good results out of the box,
I'd say very very close to the outputs you can get from Midjourney
- I tested in colab only, would be fun to try it locally
- the prompt for the image below was just "beach",
generated in a few min on colab:

{{ resize_image(path="notes/media/beach.png", width=500, height=500, op="fit_width") }}
