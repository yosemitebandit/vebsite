learning about pH probes..

<!--more-->

[a brief PDF on glass pH probes (2004)](https://www.electrochem.org/dl/interface/sum/sum04/IF6-04-Pages19-20.pdf)

* the alkali metals in the thin (0.1mm) glass membrane undergoes ion exchange
with the surrounding solution
* typically have a combined concentric design --
the inner vessel has one electrode surrounded by a constant buffer,
the outer ring has a reference electrode exposed to the solution
* I think you need temp compensation..but maybe having the ref takes care of that?
* two buffer calibration sets the linear relationship
* also need high impedance amplifier electronics (as the glass is very high impedance)
* should only report pH to the hundreths
as the calibration solutions don't get any better than that
* also notes practical reproducibility is +/- 0.05 units
* alkali metals (Na+ or K+) can interfere --
a special lithium glass can be used to mitigate this
* proteins can absorb to the surface to interfere with measurements
* no longer do probes need to remain wet and hydrated for proper measurement
