Making a kitchen stand to go next to our stove..

### top surface

I'd like the top to be a cutting surface --
a butcher block design with endgrain facing up is popular.
People say this is easier on knives
as the grains can split a bit and give way as the blade descends.
The fibers can also reseal themselves and the surface won't show as many cutting marks.

Designs using softwood endgrains can be better than those with hardwood edge grains --
[more info here](http://www.cuttingboard.com/blog/butcher-blocks-vs-cutting-boards-whats-the-difference).
I'm all for using cheaper softwoods..
Though boards made with maple, oak, beech, walnut, cherry or ash
will be more ding-resistant and less likely to warp.
Bamboo is a popular choice too.

some projects:

* [hard maple countertop](http://www.instructables.com/id/Butcher-Block-Counter-Top/)
* [pine endgrain](https://craftcollective.wordpress.com/2011/06/14/52-create-pine-end-grain-cutting-board/)

Should the top be detachable..?  That'd be interesting..
but it doesn't seem to be a common thing that's done.
Looks like protecting and cleaning these boards isn't too hard.


### pricing the top surface

The top surface will be 25 1/4 x 29" at most -> 732in<sup>2</sup>.

* 1.5" thick -> 1098in<sup>3</sup>
* 2" thick -> 1464in<sup>3</sup>
* 3" thick -> 2196in<sup>3</sup>

| | | | | |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Menard's | cherry | 1 x 6 x 8' | $41.25 | $0.104 / in<sup>3</sup> |
| | red oak | 2 x 6 x 8' | $76.69 | $0.096 / in<sup>3</sup> |
| | soft maple | 1 x 2 x 10' | $14.20 | $0.105 / in<sup>3</sup> |
| Bruce Bauer | #2 pine | 2 x 2 | $0.69 / lf | $0.026 / in<sup>3</sup> |
| | redwood | 2 x 2 | $1.00 / lf | $0.037 / in<sup>3</sup> |
| | maple | 1 x 4 | $2.70 / lf | $0.086 / in<sup>3</sup> |
| | maple | 2 x 2 | $8.48 / lf (!) | |
| OSH | oak | 1/2 x 3 x 2' | $3.49 | $0.097 / in<sup>3</sup> |
| HD | "whitewood" | 2 x 4 x 8' | $2.56 | $0.005 / in<sup>3</sup> |

so a 3" thick surface made from 2x4s should cost around $11 --
seems like that's worth a try.

### several months later..

I used oak + spruce + pine and apparently got a piece of beech too, according to George:

me and Nora hand planed the top quite a bit..

more touchups and planing to come!
