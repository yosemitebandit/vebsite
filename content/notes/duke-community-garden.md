I loved working at the garden --
we built raised beds, a hoop house, a shed, a bat box, bluebird houses, compost bins
and an experimental rainwater harvesting system.
I surveyed the site and helped work with volunteers at other area gardens too
(like the excellent Durham group [SEEDS](http://www.seedsnc.org/)).

Made so many friends here -- Emily, Margareta, Daniel, Kellyn, Joe..
More photos are on [our old flickr page here](https://www.flickr.com/photos/35445571@N03/).
Hope to be part of another garden someday!
