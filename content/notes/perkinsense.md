These were sensors I designed and built for the Perkins library at Duke when I was a senior.
The Duke study rooms are extremely popular and this project helped people find open ones.
Battery-powered and running on 8-bit AVRs, they used a rather fickle WiFi module called the 'WiFly.'
This was one of my first web projects -- the backend was, uh, interesting.
But there was a very basic web interface that showed the status of the ~20 rooms.

Alas, the project is no more and code and schematics are lost to me..perhaps someone else has copies?
The video above gives a good overview of how things were.
(And [here's another](http://ondemand.duke.edu/video/23338/perkinsense-a-new-way-to-find-).)
