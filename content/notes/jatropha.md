Kerosene for lamps and generators is incredibly expensive in Uganda,
with some households spending 30% of their income on the fuel.
We wanted to work with RASD and explore the possibilities of small-scale bio-oil production
using [Piteba presses](https://www.piteba.com/index.html).
The presses used a candle to heat a hand-cranked screw press.
We made quite a bit of peanut butter during testing in the States
and the presses proved to work decently well with jatropha seeds.
The seeds are poisonous if ingested so some safety precautions had to be observed.
We worked with RASD to find a small quantity of ripe seeds but,
after producing a small amount of oil, we were unable to ignite it in any sort of lamp apparatus.

Further research was needed on precisely when to pick the jatropha seeds
and how long to store them prior to expelling.
And we unfortunately did not even scratch the surface
of building an organizational structure for collecting seeds in appreciable quantities
(probably the more interesting problem compared to figuring out how to squeeze more oil).
Dan Moss completed a great write-up of the work

The backstory for this project is pretty interesting:
Uganda once had a booming vanilla industry and,
vanilla being a vine, the many plants required a support structure.
The jatropha plant was a popular choice for many Ugandan farmers as it grew very rapidly
and was native to the area.
Vanilla waned after some time (Madagascar's production recovered, we were told)
and people began noticing that the abundance of jatropha seeds were an excellent candidate for bio-oil production.

While in Uganda in 2007, my friend Lee Pearson organized a trip
to Royal Van Zanten's enormous flower-growing operation, just a short distance from the capital.
Many flower exporters have greenhouses in Uganda because of the excellent climate
and the small timezone difference between East Africa and Europe.
Thousands of tons of flowers are flown to the Netherlands every week.
RVZ was just in the midst of a large-scale jatropha operation
intending to power their generators with jatropha-based biodiesel.
They had previously employed several truck drivers to collect the seeds
in surrounding communities and had recently planted every spare acre
of their land with the bushy plants.
We were given a tour of their industrial expelling and filtration process
(led by Bas van Lankfeld, I believe).
