I'm reading [this PDF from UGA](http://cmbe.engr.uga.edu/bche3180/Oxygen%20Transfer%20Lab.pdf)
on oxygen mass transfer..some notes:

<!--more-->

* like temperature changes, the rate at which a gas dissolves in a liquid is proportional
to the difference between the equilibrium concentration and the present concentration --
when the liquid has no dissolved gas, the dissolution rate is at a max,
and when the liquid is saturated, the rate is zero
* a liquid is "saturated" when it reaches this equilibrium concentration
* the mass transfer coefficient is the proportion of the concentration difference and the transfer rate
(so that's units of `mg / L / mg / h` or `h / L` ?)
