..I'd hate for this sidebar site to be my main thing --
it'd be fun to be more creative

like what about a generative site..
you scroll down and roots continue being created in the side/background.
and you can browse back into old projects.
maybe you have to hack them away to actually read the site.
generative flowers and animals on the notes site

or maybe the projects page scrolls horizontally,
everybody loves stuff like that :|

something more colorful ala [substack](substack.net)

something a bit less prosaic and predictable,
I mean, that's ok for the blog stuff,
but the projects section should be fun..
