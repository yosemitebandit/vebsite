I'm going through the edX course, MITx 10.03 Making Biologic Medicines for Patients:
The Principles of Biopharmaceutical Manufacturing
led by Drs Chris Love, Stacy Springs and Paul Barone,
here are some notes:

<!--more-->

### unit one
* Dec 1983 -- genzyme makes alglucerase, the first synthetically engineered beta-glucocerebrosidase,
an enzyme that, when lacking, causes Gaucher's Disease
* biologic medicines are quite broad according to the FDA --
proteins (the focus of this course), vaccines, blood components,
cell therapies, natural hormones and plant / animal extract
  * cell therapy: something like injecting live T-cells into a patient --
  alternative medicine has also co-opted this term to injecting non-human cells
  * animal extract: for example, insulin from pigs
* these engineered proteins are quite complex --
monoclonal antibodies are 1.3k amino acids and 144k Daltons
  * compare that to "small molecule drugs" -- <1k daltons
* first hybridoma created in 1975 by Georges Kohler and Cesar Milstein
  * they had to be further "humanized" (glycosolated?) to make them effective in humans
* some history:
  * ~7000BC: a pot from China was used to make something like wine..cool
  * the 1850s: Pasteur characterized the activity of yeast and bacteria in distillery equipment in Lille
  * 1894: antibody therapy was inadverntely created with a diphtheria treatment
  involving a "serum" from guinea pigs that had been infected with a heat-inactivated bacteria --
  later horses were used to increase production
  (anti-toxins and anti-venoms are still made in horses and other animals --
  I wonder how they handle human-compatibility -- ah, the comments say that this is still a problem,
  but you are likely using the treatment for an acute and serious condition and not something chronic)
  * WWI: scientists on both sides used bacteria and yeast to make
  glycerol (for explosives), butanol (synthetic rubber precursor) and acetone (more explosives) --
  they pioneered aseptic processing where the reactors, media and equipment were sterilized
  * WWII: Howard Florey and Ernst Boris Chain worked on penicillin production in Peoria with the USDA,
  they (again serendipitously), found another species of the *Penicillium* mold
  on a cantaloupe in a farmer's market -- it made 60ug / mL.
  With X-rays and UV radiation they mutated the mold and applied some selection pressure,
  eventually finding a strain that could make 500mg / mL..wow
  * 1945: Fleming, Florey and Chain win a Nobel Prize
  * 1952: there are 58k polio cases in the US -- Salk treats Polio with a mammalian-produced product
  * 1953: Watson, Crick and Franklin deduced the double helix structure of DNA
  * 1973: recombinant DNA tech (plasmid injection)
  * the 80s: genzyme makes that Gaucher's enzyme..but it takes 20k placentas to treat 1 child / yr, wow..
  they soon looked into recombinant techniques
* the steps of biomanufacturing:
  * cell line dev: recombinant DNA techniques + variant selection
  * upstream processing: reactor condition optimization
  * downstream processing: purification and recovery
  * fill and finish: adding other components to the active pure product to make a final drug
