Recently, several projects I've worked on have made me want to know more about machine learning.
Here are some online resources I've found:

* [2012 Coursera Neural Net course from Geoffrey Hinton](https://class.coursera.org/neuralnets-2012-001)
* the [hacker's guide to neural nets](http://karpathy.github.io/neuralnets/) --
js and not quite complete
* [Stanford CNN notes](http://cs231n.github.io/)
* a [udemy course](https://www.udemy.com/data-science-deep-learning-in-python/#/) that eventually gets to TensorFlow
* the famous [course from Andrew Ng](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning/home/week/1)
* background on [perceptrons and more](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/chap1.html)
