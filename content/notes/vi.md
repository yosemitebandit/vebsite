I just read through `vimtutor` and found some things I'd like to start using:

* `change <motion>` with `c`, instead of, say, `dwi`
* replace mode: single chars with `r` or `R` to just start clobbering text
* "find under cursor" with `*`
* still getting used to `s` instead of `xi`
* `N` to go backwards through search results

Some other notes:

* find and replace within a selection:
  * select a block visually
  * type : to start entering a command
  * s/red/green/g to change all reds to greens
  * this was a bit confusing as non-visual mode selection is the same command but with a percent sign :/

* find/replace a word under the cursor
as per [this article](http://vim.wikia.com/wiki/Search_and_replace_the_word_under_the_cursor)
  * type `*`
  * `ciw` (change inner word)
  * `<esc>`
  * then `n` (next occurrence)
  * and `.` (repeat change)

* I've been building little go scripts in vim and this pops up the quickfix pane when there's an error
  * my vimrc has two ways of hiding this: call ToggleErrors() and :ccl

* opening ctrlp selections in a split:
  * with the file highlighted, type ctrl-x to open in a horizontal split
  * ctrl-v opens in a vertical split
  * I still almost always create the split first

* I keep forgetting I have easy-motion
  * jump to the letter d, anywhere:
  * `<leader>ssd`

* I should learn snippets..

* better wrapping to 80char cols [in python](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3033423):
  * `set textwidth=79`
  * `gqq` to format the current line
