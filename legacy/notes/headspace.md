The headspace app has been huge for me --
I've used it since the last few months of 2015,
doing 10 and 20 min exercises about every day.
I especially appreciate the focus on "the now"
that the app helps remind me of.
And it has helped me bring a feeling of peace and well-being to my life.
The "creativity module" has been challenging but rewarding,
some very interesting techniques in this one.

And the "7 Weeks" app has helped me continue the practice
of this and other good habits -- I can definitely recommend that tool as well.
