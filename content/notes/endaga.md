I worked for about six months at [Endaga](https://www.endaga.com),
building low cost cellular infrastructure.
Endaga built cell phone tower hardware -- entrepreneurs could buy our equipment
and use our cloud services to become the "Verizon" of their area.

I loved working on this project and with the team --
Shaddi, Kurtis, Lance, Kashif, Omar and Mona.
I helped maintain the backend code running on our servers
and I worked on the code that ran on the towers themselves.
We maintained billing and usage data, hand-built some of the early boxes,
worked on interesting networking challenges, built cool react-based frontends,
and connected lots of folks to the wider world.
It was very rewarding and fun work.

The founding team was acquired by Facebook, but we all parted on good terms.
Definitely looking forward to what they do next with the team in Menlo Park!

Update!  The Endaga work is part of [Facebook TIP](http://telecominfraproject.com)
and the software should be open sourced before too long!
