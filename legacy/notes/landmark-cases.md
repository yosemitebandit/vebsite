I'm listening to Stephen Breyer on City Arts and Lectures
(what a great show, btw, wish I could get older mp3s..).
He's a great speaker,
and I love listening to the "insider baseball" of the SC, as Breyer calls it.
His discussion of cases also reveals many interesting historical tidbits..
He has written some books that might be worth looking at.

PBS has a [series on landmark cases](http://www.pbs.org/wnet/supremecourt/future/landmark_bush.html)
that looks interesting.
