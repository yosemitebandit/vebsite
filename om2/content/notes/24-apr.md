:snake: Demon Copperhead
- I used Libby to listen to Barbara Kingsolver's recent novel
about growing up in western VA, the foster system and drug addiction
- It's very bleak and made me curious to know more about the Purdue Pharma scandal;
these articles look good: https://www.pulitzer.org/winners/eric-eyre

:kite: The Autobiography of Ben Franklin
- I'm listening to this now. I think I had to read excerpts from this back in high school!
- "sometimes a speckled axe is best" --
BF's tale of the man who wants his axe honed to the point that it shines,
but the smith requires him to turn the wheel himself.
I think BF is saying that some people can't put in the effort and instead convince themselves that "speckled is best"
.. and he himself admits that his quest for perfect morals left him feeling this way
- access to books was a huge thing for him in his youth,
and later he wrote Poor Richard's Almanac as a kind of civic good,
a way to spread knowledge to the masses,
and he took pride that it was a perennial bestseller
and sometimes the only book people owned

:sailboat: Hornblower IV
- HH is back at it, this time in the Baltic Sea

:ireland: Claire Keegan's _Foster_
- wonderful Novella -- I listened to it via Libby
- beautiful language and imagery, especially the dialogue from the Kinsella's
- a lovely review on the [California Review of Books](https://calirb.com/foster-by-claire-keegan/)
- what is she warning Kinsella of in the end??

:fountain_pen: Prime Gaps
- really cool from [Dr. Will Wood](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gP7DZ4TiFz4)

:art: _The Principles of Uncertainty_
- I've been reading Maira Kalman's second (?) book as a quasi-story book for the baby,
it meanders but I don't think baby minds
- the colors are truly great!
