Loved working at the garden --
built raised beds, a shed, a bat box, bluebird houses, compost bins
and an experimental rainwater harvesting system.
I surveyed the site and helped work with volunteers at the Duke site and others.

Made so many friends there -- Emily, Margareta, Kellyn, Joe..
hope to be part of another garden someday!
