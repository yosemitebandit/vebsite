My friend [Trevor](http://trevorshp.com) organized a ride from Gilroy to SLO
over Memorial day weekend -- our campsites:
Mt. Madonna SP outside Gilroy,
Veteran's Park in downtown Monterey,
Kirk Creek in Big Sur
and the San Simeon Creek Campground near Hearst Castle.

Southbound is definitely the way to go -- more tailwinds that way.
And the days aren't too taxing -- we do roughly 50mi per day.
The ride to Kirk Creek is the longest at almost 70mi
and also the hardest because of the hills.

I had just one mechanical issue, albeit a big one:
my chain snapped as I left the Kirk Creek campground.
We had decided to camp at Pacific Valley that night,
a campsite about 4-5mi up the road but, after my little snafu,
we ended up staying at Kirk Creek.
We had stayed there for last year's July 4th ride
and I again swam in the ocean with the sea otters for about 30s -- it's insanely cold.

The pics are still coming in so I'll have to add those later!
