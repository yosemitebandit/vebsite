:cold_face: Fargo, Big Lebowski
- an inadvertent Coen Bros trend!
- loved the imdb trivia on these -- helped me understand the point of the "Mike" scene in Fargo:
it establishes that some people lie categorically
and helps prompt Frances McDormand to re-investigate William Macy
- maybe we'll check out the new-ish Fargo TV series too

:mountain: The Sound of Music
- an Xmas tradition is born
- this was one of like three movies we had at home so I know almost all the songs, very fun
- and I just learned it's based on a true story, and the movie is relatively faithful to the story!
- there are also great lullabies here
- ChatGPT did an ok job extending "favorite things" with new stanzas..but I guess some repetition for the baby won't be noticed!

- watching pieces of this aoe2 tournament on youtube
- insane game4 between Hera and Tatoh
- awesome game1 between Hera and Yo
