The real action's at [yosemitebandit.github.io/stravanova](http://yosemitebandit.github.io/stravanova).

Stravanova plays and overlays gpx files.
It can be one rider on multiple rides or multiple riders doing the same ride.
The start times are normalized.
A python script interpolates points such that the dataset has a position for every second.
This gives time-accurate and smooth playback, although it will put your computer through its paces..

It's [on github](https://github.com/yosemitebandit/stravanova).
