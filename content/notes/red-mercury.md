Entertaining [NYT piece on "red mercury"](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/22/magazine/the-doomsday-scam.html),
a fabled substance sought after by many.

Some say it's cached in sewing machines with butterfly logos..
Others that it's repelled by garlic and attracted to gold.
Other variants (green, silver, etc) are for medicinal purposes
or act as sexual stimulants.

But handle the hot, red variety incorrectly,
and "a radius of eight kilometers around you will be destroyed!"
Bad luck if you're colorblind I guess.
