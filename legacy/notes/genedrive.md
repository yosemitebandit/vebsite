notes from Hammond et. al's paper in Nature Biotech:
[A CRISPR-Cas9 gene drive system targeting female reproduction in the malaria mosquito vector Anopheles gambiae](http://www.nature.com/nbt/journal/v34/n1/full/nbt.3439.html)
and the [Wyss lab's gene drive FAQ](http://wyss.harvard.edu/staticfiles/newsroom/pressreleases/Gene%20drives%20FAQ%20FINAL.pdf).

*abstract*

* they found three genes that confer a recessive female-sterility phenotype in mosquitos,
inserted them and found transmission rates of >90%

*background*

* synthetic gene drive systems were proposed over ten years ago
but were only recently made possible via CRISPR-Cas9
  * CRISPR draws inspiration from bacteria that protect themselves from viruses
  by hiding "pristine" copies of their DNA and then repairing viral alterations based on this template
