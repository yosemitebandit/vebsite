- "The customer always ends up pulling—ripping(!)—it out of your hands when you hit a real pain point."
- reminds me of _The Mom Test_

:evergreen_tree: [Naval on the conditioning of ones desires](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSHJXCngrWI)
- "deep down, nobody is doing it for themselves"
- reminds me of the idea of the baby's cry,
how it instinctually makes you feel what they are feeling

- the recommendation at the end to support charities to bridge the gap and improve child mortality --
this doesn't sit quite right with me, and it's something we used to talk about in college when I worked with EWB.
- The success of the EU counterexample in the article wasn't built with charity.
- I instinctually want to see something more foundational, and a patchwork of charities is unsatisfying (both in the US and abroad)
- Do these external charities supplant systems that should be built as local private or public institutions?
- Well many charities, though they are proxy govt services, are probably run by locals anyway, certainly they're staffed by locals.
- And maybe you just need a stable, healthy, more equitable base of society to even begin making any deeper, self-determined progress.
- And the best charities would be built for commitment, longevity and impact.
- The top GiveWell charities are actually not about digging wells or creating new hospital systems anyway --
right now they are about providing malaria meds and nets, and providing vitamin supplements.
These seem to plug in to existing local programs and "infrastructure"
- GiveWell publishes a whole section on ["Our Mistakes"](https://www.givewell.org/about/our-mistakes) which is so cool.

- played around with this model and writing a simple app to do image processing,
it worked very well for iteration and debugging
- I had tried GPT3 for a simple app in the past,
but I got discouraged because I felt it led me astray for hours.. this was much more promising!
