A friend recommended this [wait but why article](http://waitbutwhy.com/2015/11/the-cook-and-the-chef-musks-secret-sauce.html)
on Elon Musk.

<!--more-->

* The author believes there is a technique in use whereby desires from a "want" pool
are combined with possibilities from a "reality" pool
and formed into goals via some continually adjusting strategy.
He recommends you nimbly adjust each of these pools based on your personal changes,
changes to the world and results from your previous actions.
And the reasoning behind these decisions should be built from the ground up --
Musk calls it building from "first principles."
It seems to mean to think for yourself and be cautious of prejudice.
* Elon wanted to be an engineer rather than a scientist
because the former provides the data that the latter depend on.
* He wanted to do "wondrous" things, but also things important for humanity's future.
* The author argues Musk's "brain software" is well understood by Musk himself,
and that it is constantly optimized for the changing world.
* I think the author is wrong about his Great Depression point --
that was 1930, more than two generations away from now,
there aren't many people raised by parents that grew up in that era.
* He also conflates dogmatic thinking with trusting the ideas of others --
it's not practical to say that we should reason everything out from first principles on our own.
* Bonus Feynman quote: "I was born not knowing and
have had only a little time to change that here and there."
* The author is pushing us to examine our own "brain software,"
and to search for unjustified certainty --
there should be verified data backing those thoughts,
if there's not, you've found dogma..
* And a nice Jobs quote: "Life can be much broader once you discover one simple fact.
And that is: Everything around you that you call life was made up by people that were no smarter than you.
And you can change it, you can influence it, you can build your own things that other people can use."
* Other points line up well with Otavio's points:
fail with enthusiasm, understand the kinds of risk you're facing..
* Don't get trapped in your own history -- more good advice.
