*mistakes*

* need multi MM of preorders to get institutional investors excited
* focus the pitch on customer metrics (rather than revenue and margin)
* CMs begrudgingly work with startups..you have to provide some value for them too,
like giving them a chance to work in a new area
* recommends not crowdfunding until you've nailed down product dev..
at least to the point that you understand BOM, COGS, margin, etc
* don't waste time and $35k on a patent before you have institutional funding
* budget a marketer / sales person for your first raise
* [the time between seed and series A is the valley of death for hw startups](https://blog.bolt.io/the-hardware-startup-valley-of-death-f66be30665e7#.sewnncehq)..
  * hard to show growth and traction
  * it's fundraising and manufacturing hell when you approach from 100 - 1k - 10k units built
  (haven't yet economies of scale)
  * quality issues getting fixed, but still not selling that many units
  * forgot to focus on customer acq
  * additional recommendation: have a large lead investor in the seed round that can bridge


*coin*

* combined all your credit cards into one custom card
* assets recently acquired by fitbit.. existing products will work til the battery dies :(
* tech risk: coin seemingly was able to overcome this, building largely what they said they would
* product risk: failing to live up to expectations -- this'll be high if product failures are high stakes,
low if failures are mere annoyances
* I guess they're saying coin's failures were "high stakes,"
because you may have left all your other credit cards at home
* high risk: 1-2 failures over the lifetime of the product create a negative interaction,
related to critical business ops (like a POS system), failure creates safety / security problem
* your startup should take on high product risk *or* high tech risk
* fellow in the comments recommends validating the idea with off the shelf systems as much as possible
