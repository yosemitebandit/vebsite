#### things I've made

* my first attempt at turkey was via [this recipe](http://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1015474-simple-roast-turkey)
and I usually hate this particular kind of bird, but I loved the result here
* we also made [mushroom-bacon stuffing](http://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1015422-two-way-stuffing-with-mushrooms-and-bacon),
quite tasty -- cut the bread small and make sure it doesn't get too dry
* this [sour cream crust](http://www.simplyrecipes.com/m/recipes/sour_cream_pie_crust/)
was the best part of my homemade pumpkin pie
* my sister made this [squash cashew soup](http://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1014339-creamy-cashew-butternut-squash-soup) --
very nice
* this [bread recipe](http://www.food.com/recipe/quick-yeast-bread-89164)
was very straightforward and quick -- tasted good and had a nice crust


#### things that look interesting

* [ecuadorean cuisine](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/22/magazine/small-country-many-tastes.html)
(sans guinea pigs `:|`) -- includes seafood and plaintains, meat and cheese potato cakes,
and tuna stew
* [soy sauce cured eggs](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/29/magazine/drinking-food.html)
