I want to start working on a yet-to-be-named project
that turns webcam streams into graphs --
I'm thinking mostly for industrial spaces,
but I could practice on data from public webcams..

The NPS has [lots of public webcams](http://www.nature.nps.gov/air/webcams/) --
they monitor air quality in Yosemite:

They show some amazing vistas (this is Glacier National Park):

and "Electric Peak" at Mammoth:

And they just have cool tourist shots
like at [Old Faithful](https://www.nps.gov/features/yell/webcam/oldFaithfulStreaming.html):

You can also find more mundane streams and do boring stuff like counting cars:
