I led a small team in the production of 70 ECG calibration devices.
Feedback from Engineering World Health's partners in the field indicated
that these devices were very useful and that more were needed.

The hardware, designed by a student group of yore,
created sinusoidal waveforms and emulated heartbeats to assist in the calibration of electrocardiogram machines.

I sourced the parts for these devices and organized weekly builds where the solder flowed freely.
After in-house testing, we gave them to the EWH national group,
where they were sent along with trained volunteers to Central American hospitals.
