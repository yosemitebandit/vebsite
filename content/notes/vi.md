I just read through `vimtutor` and found some things I'd like to start using:

* `change <motion>` with `c`, instead of, say, `dwi`
* replace mode: single chars with `r` or `R` to just start clobbering text
* "find under cursor" with `*`
* still getting used to `s` instead of `xi`
* `N` to go backwards through search results
