Entertaining [NYT piece on "red mercury"](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/22/magazine/the-doomsday-scam.html),
a fabled substance sought after by many.

Some say it's cached in sewing machines..
Others that it's repelled by garlic.
Other variants (green, silver, etc) are for medicinal purposes.

But handle the hot, red variety incorrectly,
and "a radius of eight kilometers around you will be destroyed!"
