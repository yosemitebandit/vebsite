:book: Wuthering Heights
- I tried listening to Bronte's classic on Libby
- I really tried, I did, I made it 30% of the way through.
I am so lost. I can't follow the characters or story, 
Heathcliff has reappeared and is a rogue of some sort. 
- I'm returning the book early and reading the beginning of the plot on Wikipedia,
maybe I'll give it another go someday.
- (ok based on a quick read of the beginning of the article on wikipedia,
in which I think I've avoided spoilers, I think I should try again, but in text vs audio)


:book: Atlas Six
- Olivie Blake's novel, I listened to a good chunk of it via Libby,
but I couldn't finish --
I just found it hokey when the swat team came to fight,
and honestly, in the audiobook production, I didn't like that each character had their own reader.
- the plot is sort of a Harry Potter-type world + competition,
but it's all closer to R/PG-13
- it was originally self-published via Kindle, how cool


:droplet: Swiss Munitions
- [NYT story](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/20/world/europe/switzerland-lakes-munitions-bombs-prize.html)
of a $58k prize to develop ideas for removing (or encapsulating?) discarded munitions
left hundreds of feet below the surface in various Swiss lakes
- We saw one of these lakes about a year ago -- Lake Thun, beautiful!

- It would be a fun challenge -- 
there's no word on the size of what's down there
or, like, what containers they expect to find.
- The question posed in the article
is whether the munitions can be removed without disturbing more sediment
or further breaking apart things as you take em out
