I designed and built some room occupancy sensors for the Perkins library at Duke when I was a senior.
The study rooms there are extremely popular and spread over four floors --
this project helped people find ones that were unoccupied.
Battery-powered and running on 8-bit AVRs, they used a rather fickle WiFi module called the 'WiFly.'
This was one of my first web projects -- the backend was, uh, interesting.
But there was a very basic web interface that showed the status of the ~20 rooms.

Alas, the project is no more and code and schematics are lost to me..perhaps someone else has copies?
[This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oXoiZqXyRsg) gives a good overview of how things were.
(And [here's another video with even more](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCnKYD7xo_w)!)
