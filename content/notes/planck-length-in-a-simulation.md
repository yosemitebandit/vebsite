Wikipedia's excellent notes on the Planck length:

> The size of the Planck length can be visualized as follows:
if a particle or dot about 0.1 mm in size
(which is approximately the smallest the unaided human eye can see)
were magnified in size to be as large as the observable universe,
then inside that universe-sized "dot",
the Planck length would be roughly the size of an actual 0.1 mm dot.

The value is about 1.616199(97) * 10^-35 m
and is regarded as the shortest measurable length.
