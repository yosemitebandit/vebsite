notes on my 2016 vote:

<!--more-->

* I voted Hillary for her policies,
CA AG Kamala Harris for her pro-environment stances (though her opponent dabbed at the debate, haha),
the incumbent, Anna Eshoo for her track record and policies,
Jerry Hill for his record on the environment,
Vicki Veenker for all the endorsements she earned from env groups ( :/ ),
Grace Mah for her experience,
Lucas Ramirez, Thida Cornes, Chris Clark and Margaret Abe-Koga
based on their endorsements from the Santa Clara League of Conservation Voters
* state propositions.. thank god for [ballot.fyi](https://ballot.fyi) I voted yes on:
  * 52 (Medi-Cal hospital fee disbursements),
  * 58 (allows local groups decide how to teach English in their communities)
  * 59 (advise the legislature to attempt to overturn the Citizens United decision)
  * 62 (repeal the death penalty)
  * 63 (stricter regulations around ammunition sales)
  * 64 (legalizing pot)
  * 65 (plastic bag fees go to an env fund)
  * 67 (statewide ban on plastic bags)
* I voted no on:
  * 51 ($9B bond to upgrade schools)
  * 53 (statewide voters have to approve revenue bonds > $2B)
  * 54 (legislative bills frozen for 72hrs)
  * 55 (extending tax increase on highest earners)

  * 60 (requiring adult film performers to wear condoms)
  * 61 (state agencies will attempt to pay what the VA pays for prescription drugs)
  * 66 (changes death penalty procedures -- would've preempted my 'yes' vote on 62)
* local stuff:
  * yes on A (affordable housing bond), B (sales tax increase for transit improvements)
  and W (rent stabilization arbitration),
  but no on V (rent stabilization amendment -- creates a weird, unelected parallel council)
