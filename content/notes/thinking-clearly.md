I bought a paper (!) copy of this book, [The Art of Thinking Clearly](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16248196-the-art-of-thinking-clearly).
It would do well as a set of flashcards..
But it is a good read!
Dobelli reviews a compendium of logical fallacies,
meditating on each a bit and casting them in various personal terms.

#### survivorship bias
We overestimate our chance of success because
we're naturally drawn to pay attention to the success of others.
There's no compelling story in comprehensive failure, so we don't hear it.

#### the swimmer's body illusion
Confusing the factor of selection for the results.

#### clustering illusion
A proclivity towards seeing patterns when there are none.
