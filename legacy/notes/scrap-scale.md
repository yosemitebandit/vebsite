When the electricity went off in Nkokonjeru
I (finally) had an excuse to stop welding the gates for RASD, the NGO where we worked.
Some other projects at the site needed to weigh things, so I tried making a scale.

I used a moment-balance system where a known volume of water(usually 500mL)
would be shifted until it balanced the load on the other side of the scale.
It's somewhat similar to a physician's scale for weighing people.
I used a bike hub and some tough wood to form the scale's body --
scrap metal on the short end helped cancel the weight of the long arm.

When it was working, Abhinav Kapur and I estimated a 40g precision.
I made the mistake of taking the balance apart before finishing a second, nicer version.
Version two, of course, was never completed. Sigh.
I'd like to put one together in the States and employ the convenience of so many nice power tools,
it would be handy to have a scale around.
