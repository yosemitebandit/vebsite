Spent this morning reading *And The Pursuit of Happiness*,
Maira Kalman's wonderful collection of watercolors and
meditations on the country, her travels and her life.

Much (all?) of this book comes from her [NYT blog](http://kalman.blogs.nytimes.com/)
of the same name.
I love her portraits.

And her thoughts on invention:

> Everything is invented.
Language.  Childhood.  Careers.
Relationships.  Religion.
Philosophy.  The Future.
They are not there for the plucking.
They don't exist in some natural state.
They must be invented by people.
And that, of course, is a great thing.
Don't mope in your room.
Go invent something.
That is the American message.
