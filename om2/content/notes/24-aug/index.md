:book: Wuthering Heights
- I tried listening to Bronte's classic on Libby
- I really tried, I did, I made it 30% of the way through.
I am so lost. I can't follow the characters or story, 
Heathcliff has reappeared and is a rogue of some sort. 
- I'm returning the book early and reading the beginning of the plot on Wikipedia,
maybe I'll give it another go someday.
- (ok based on a quick read of the beginning of the article on wikipedia,
in which I think I've avoided spoilers, I think I should try again, but in text vs audio)
