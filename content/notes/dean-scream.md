A [short documentary](http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-dean-scream-what-really-happened/)
on the "Dean Scream" from 2004.

* bonus Dave Chappelle clip..
* probably with the benefit of hindsight,
Dean himself says in the piece that he succumbed to his desire to get people fired up
* before the Iowa caucuses he was around the top of the pack (alongside Kerry, Edwards and Lieberman),
but was slipping a bit because of his temperament -- or the narrative about it
* he gave the famous speech on the night of the Iowa vote,
a vote in which he came in a disappointing third
* other footage from the event shows it was really loud -- there were 3500 people there
* he actually cracks a pretty funny joke about it..
* and most people in the documentary claim that, rather than the scream being his undoing,
it was his lack of a result in Iowa that sunk his campaign (he left the race soon after)
* he was the first candidate to raise millions online,
but failed to galvanize more than the youth vote
