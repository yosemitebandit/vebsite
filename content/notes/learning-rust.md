I'd like to do some homegrown machine learning work in rust

* the compiler is great, have yet to find a way to get compilation results in vim's quickfix window,
syntastic is also missing errors
* I smiled at the "return on the statement with no semicolon" idea --
can also drop the last semicolon if it's the last statement in a scope, I think
* underscores for readability in ints is cool --
like `1_000_000u32` is one million
