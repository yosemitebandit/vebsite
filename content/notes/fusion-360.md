I just learned that Fusion 360 is free for "enthusiasts" --
it's an excellent modeling program.
I tried 123D Design and had issues with it on mac.
In the past I've used Sketchup, OpenSCAD and, to a limited extent, Solidworks and FreeCAD,
but Fusion 360 is my favorite of the bunch.

* components are containers for bodies -- they're bound by their own degrees of freedom
and maintain their own origins and reference planes
* joints are used to govern positioning and motion of assembly components --
as-built joints can be used to setup how parts should move in relation to each other
once the thing is actually created
* the parametric timeline is really cool -- editing old sketches is super easy
* sculpting is also a cool mode that I had not seen before --
see the bike seat video below.  You can create more organic things in a free-form way.
* the patch workspace seems to be for creating surfaces,
as opposed to the model workspace which creates solid geometries


#### renderings

* Here's a bike seat I made, loosely following the tutorial below,
using [saddle images from this page](http://design-real.com/saddle/) and
the cloud rendering feature.  Mm.. oak.. comfy.

* And the board of my car key's remote -- I'm trying to build it a new enclosure.
