[Redwood](http://www.redwoodsystems.com) is ostensibly a lighting company,
but they also have a ton of sensor data.
I built some APIs on a MongoDB backend for managing a slice of this data in the Redwood offices.

Vinyl was a javascript visualization of this data, greatly inspired by 'Icicle,'
one of [Nathan's](http://thenoviceoof.com/) projects.
Each circle is a sensor in the building --
they light up when something moves within their detection radius.
There was a barebones UI, vaguely inspired by youtube,
that let people rewind to any part of the day or change the playback speed.
