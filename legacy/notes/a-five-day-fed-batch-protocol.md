interesting tidbits from a [very detailed fed-batch protocol](http://www.helmholtz-muenchen.de/fileadmin/PEPF/Protocols/HCDF-protocol310108.pdf):

<!--more-->

* the media is autoclaved in the vessel
* at the end of the batch phase, just before you start feeding for the first time,
your cells have used up all the starter glucose --
this is about 16hrs after inoculation in this protocol
  * the stirrer speed will *decrease* and DO might increase
  * they're guessing that other metabolites (made earlier in the process) are now being consumed
  so the growth will flatline but why does the solution get more dense..?
  * they also note that you can add several drops of 70% glucose
  to their 850mL solution and immediately you'll see the stirrer speed increase and DO decrease..
  they'll just as quickly drop (within a few seconds)
* they induce protein expression with the addition of IPTG
* their feed solution is quite similar to the media
* broth is drained into two 600mL centrifuge bottles via the manual sampler port and gravity
* they autoclave and reuse the vessel, tubing and filters --
though sometimes the tubing is too dirty and have to be tossed
* seemingly everything is autoclaved and then rinsed / scrubbed, interesting..
* they use nonlinear feeding profiles
