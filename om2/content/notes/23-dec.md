:sailboat: Hornblower
- listened to the first three books
- it's hokey in parts but great fun
- C.S. Forester was a professional propagandist and wasn't in the navy or a sailor
- would love to see some of the detailed battles illustrated -- lots of the technical sailing details are beyond me
- or I guess there's a TV series
