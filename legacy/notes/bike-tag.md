I'd like to make a new tag for when my bike's on the train.
Here are some basic renders..

I'm thinking one piece will be mounted to the seatpost and
another to-be-rendered part will insert into this and indicate where I'm off to:

![signpost b](/img/bike-tag-signpost-b.png)

maybe the insert could have a little magnet at the end to keep things in place..

![signpost c](/img/bike-tag-signpost-c.png)

![signpost a](/img/bike-tag-signpost-a.png)

I like this concept but the blue / yellow interface isn't quite right..

leveling that mount and adding a bunch of fillets..
