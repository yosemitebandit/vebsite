I want a device that can quantify the proportion of my day spent in the out-of-doors.

<!--more-->

*options*

* toggle switch (my favorite so far..)
  * push a button to activate "I'm inside" state,
  push again to toggle "I'm outside" state --
  timestamp each activity and upload to some other device for analysis
  * simple purpose-built device
  * disadvantage: no passive monitoring
  * could be a necklace or a ring
* GPS
  * just log GPS position and later determine if positions are in a building
  * would struggle with time spent on trains, time on subways, time in cities..
  * actually not really sure what would happen when inside at all --
  might show an inaccurate fix outside of a building
  * could use other gps-assist technologies available on a phone (wifi, cell towers..)
* camera
  * periodically take a picture of the surroundings
  * would probably need something purpose built and wearable --
  phone is too often in my pocket
  * may be tricked by images of windows
* phone video
  * periodically take a short video (with sound) of the surroundings
  * would also need something purpose built + wearable..
* microphone
  * record ambient noise and try to discriminate between states
  * sounds tough..
