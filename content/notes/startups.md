On working for startups in the past and possibly the future:

I've loved working on small teams throughout school, in hackathons and in the working world.
Little teams let me take on many roles and explore lots of different things,
from [hardware](/perkinsense)
to [the web](/endaga)
to [product design](/wing),
[ux](/aquaya)
and [even sales I guess](/redwood-cloud)!
I really like the opportunity to see a product,
whatever it may be, from many different angles.
You can explore ways to make it more useful, more feature-ful, better positioned, better priced..
and it's engaging to think of these systems in more nuanced ways.

It's hard for me to imagine working for a huge team,
or for a small team making a tiny part of a larger product.
And so this lends itself towards working for startups.
But why a startup over just working on a project?

All of my work to date has been on "projects" -- small scale, and for small audiences.
Often I've worked on them to practice some technical thing,
or they've had such a small number of users that they've essentially been contract work.
So it's of course exciting to imagine helping lots of people..
[do their jobs more efficiently](/mtrrdr),
[create things they otherwise couldn't](/bioreactors),
or [express themselves in new ways](https://github.com/yosemitebandit/ichabod).
I love that startups force you to put your creations out in the world.

Many anecdotes cover the stresses of startup work --
founders especially face huge demands on their attention and personal relationships often suffer.
I would hope to work in an environment that is open and intentional about this addressing this.
(The [Startup Podcast episode about burnout](https://gimletmedia.com/episode/12-burnout/)
is a really excellent look at this problem, by the way).
In general, intentionality is a value I would want to see in many aspects of the work.
I suppose introspection comes with that, along with a willingness to measure outcomes objectively.
I think openness is an attractive value to aspire towards --
at the least, the team should be transparent about their thought processes and rationales.
At best, a team's work could be entirely open all the way to the tech front
(though I understand why this can be difficult).
I would hope to work in a creative and expressive environment,
one in which diverse perspective are sought out, shared and acted upon.
And I've been fortunate to work with incredible colleagues
that have helped me grow as a person and as an engineer --
I would of course want that to continue.
