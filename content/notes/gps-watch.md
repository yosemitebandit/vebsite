There's a new GPS watch out now by garmin, I believe.
Quite expensive though..
I was thinking it'd be cool to have a very simple watch that tracked distance traveled.
For runners, say, or cyclists.

There are some very small lipos out there..but how small are (cheap) GPS parts now?
Ah, the [ultimate gps breakout](http://www.adafruit.com/products/746) from adafruit looks watch-ish,
even in breakout form..
This plus a few LEDs and a button
and [this lipo](http://www.adafruit.com/products/1578), say.

The teensy would work..though this watch is becoming more of an armband :/
Not bad for all off-the-shelf, breakout stuff.
