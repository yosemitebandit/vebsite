Me and Nora went to Berkeley!

We saw some amazing succulents at the botanical gardens, some could grow to be 2000 years old!

The other areas were quite nice as well.

We ate like royalty at Gather, Cheeseboard and many other places..
We were enticed by the Pacific Film Archive's amazing map and bookstore,
but alas, their main galleries were closed.

We saw and puzzled through *The Lobster*..
