:book: Normal People
- Sally Rooney's novel of relationships, self discovery and inner turmoil -- it was great
- I listened to it on Libby, performed by Aoife McMahon
- I found it very moving in parts
- The podcast _Good Scribes Only_ has a short review,
as does [the NYT](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/08/books/review-normal-people-sally-rooney.html)
which links Rooney's novels to Rachel Cusk's Outline series, and I think I agree with that


:bug: David Hillis's Tree of Life
- in 2003, this UT Austin lab mapped rRNA similarity between ~3k species to produce this graphic;
his original pdf is [here](http://www.zo.utexas.edu/faculty/antisense/DownloadfilesToL.html)

- his description: 
  - "This tree is from an analysis of small subunit rRNA sequences sampled
  from about 3,000 species from throughout the Tree of Life.
  The species were chosen based on their availability,
  but we attempted to include most of the major groups,
  sampled very roughly in proportion to the number of known species in each group
  (although many groups remain over- or under-represented).
  The number of species represented is approximately the square-root of the number of species thought to exist on Earth
  (i.e., three thousand out of an estimated nine million species),
  or about 0.18% of the 1.7 million species that have been formally described and named."
- Wikipedia links some [more recent visualizations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_of_life_(biology)#Horizontal_gene_transfer_and_rooting_the_tree_of_life)
which are equally cool
