Lots of great videos out there on aseptic handling, woo!

<!--more-->

### [aseptic handling during cell culture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugcGo42VNqI)
* things are generally sprayed down with 70% ethanol --
I guess this evaporates super fast..seems like it would also contaminate your equipment in some sense
* but what about the stool in the video??
* try to place caps inside facing down and try not to pass your hands over top of stuff
* things *are* opened out but only under the hood -- it's downdraft actually, never knew that..
* they're dropping bio waste into a little container with a disinfectant, virkon


### [cleanliness via fire](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRadiLXkqoU)
* everything sterilized on a bunsen burner
(reminded me of a lab someone told me about
that just kept a bunsen burner running *near* the labwork to keep things clean..)


### [notes from thermo](https://www.thermofisher.com/us/en/home/references/gibco-cell-culture-basics/aseptic-technique.html)
* recommend leaving the hood on unless you're not going to use it for an extended time
* can use UV light to sterilize surfaces and air inside the hood when it's not in use
* open and close things quickly -- they also recommend you not talk, sing or whistle,
even though the hood is presumably down :(
