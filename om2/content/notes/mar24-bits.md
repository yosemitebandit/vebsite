:soccer: [The Game](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN0kmvIvvlc)
- Documentary from the New Yorker, fantastic!


:pen: [`i^i` from Black Pen Red Pen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgOzdcvPb-k)
- with the power of Euler's formula (1740)
- but Cotes had `log(cos x + isin x) = ix` in 1714, why do we focus on Euler's form?
- ah, [StackExchange explains](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/1315733/difference-between-the-formula-of-roger-cotes-and-euler),
this complex log was correct at the time but is no more!


:fire: HVAC
- I'm learning about mini-splits
- TOH install: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bMb-K_baOI
- another installation walkthrough from WA: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia8o4K9AYr8 ;
multiple outdoor units with an air handler, a variety of vents and several wall-mount units
- can we leverage the existing ducts in the crawlspace??
- Another TOH video where they install an air handler + ducts in the attic: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lb0UgFisz1E


:open_hands: [OpenCollective](https://opencollective.com)
- Anki uses this platform to run a sort of patreon-type community, pretty cool!
- looks like a handful of corporate entities which you can plug into + a way to manage finances
- "exit to community" is a cool aim as well,
where they plan to "mature into ownership by their community of stakeholders"


:book: [Mary Frances Dunham memoirs](https://dunham-family.com/dhaka-memoirs/)
- incredible set of memoirs, focused on Americans living in East Pakistan in the 60s
- I'm listening to _Midnight's Children_ now, set in the same vicinity
- also just a great project put together by a mother/daughter team, that's really touching


:house_with_garden: [Siloe Oliveira rebuilds a garden shed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWRulq1rtvM)
- bricolage!
- wonderful detail and all-around aesthetic


:shell: [Eirik Brandal's shell-tethered vesper](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R9ZAp6HtYOs)

:moon: Midnight's Children
- I listened to this phenomenal book by Salman Rushdie via Libby, with great narration by Lyndam Gregory 
- It's one of my all time favorites and I can't wait to get into it again --
the characters, setting, brilliant language, history, allusions, surreal elements -- all fantastic
- I liked the recaps and discussions on this book from the podcasts _Good Scribes Only_ and _Open Book_
