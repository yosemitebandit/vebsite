I had an amazing time traveling in Cambodia while working for [Aquaya](http://aquaya.org).
I spent just a few hours in Phnom Penh --
most of my time was with Kounthy and Livy of the Teuk Saat NGO,
working in the excellent town of Battambang.

Here's me giving a certificate to Chhong Bora.

Tem, Kounthy and I toured Banteay Chhmar:

And Livy and I went to Wat Banon --
stairway up to the temple on one side of the hill,
landmines on the other.
