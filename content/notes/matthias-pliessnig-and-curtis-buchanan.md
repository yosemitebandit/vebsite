The boat he built at RISD looks amazing --
the [Montfort Classic 12](http://gaboats.com/boats/classic12.html).
I'd love to see more of his boats and more info on the steaming process.

and another profile on the chairmaker Curtis Buchanan:

"Contentment is underrated," he says.
Love the story on how he got started with this --
over the last 30 years he's probably made 1500 chairs.
