I'm on parental leave :baby: :boom:
and, in between diaper changes and bottle feeding,
I've rebuilt my vebsite.

Source is [here](https://github.com/yosemitebandit/vebsite/tree/zola):
- uses the [`zola`](https://www.getzola.org/) framework.
- cloudflare -- for both DNS and the static site
- I plan to transfer old pages to the new site

I also setup :moon: [`lunarvim`](https://www.lunarvim.org/) in service of this project
and that has been really nice!
With `vim`, I use various plugins and custom keybinds --
I'm surrendering a lot of that for the `lunarvim` defaults.
My customization, so far, is [just a few small things](https://github.com/yosemitebandit/dotdotdot/blob/b89a66fcad6d762724ff759a069ee398c1302d4a/lvim-config.lua).
