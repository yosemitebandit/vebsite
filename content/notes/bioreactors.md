I've been learning about bioreactors and fermenters:
devices used to grow bacterial and mammalian cells.
There are a lot of interesting startups in the synthetic bio space
that use bioengineered organisms to produce unique proteins --
these companies need bioreactors to run experiments.

### basics
* [2011 article on single use vs stainless steel bioreactors](http://www.genengnews.com/gen-articles/finding-a-bioreactor-that-s-right-for-you/3750/)
  * there are even benchtop autoclavable vessels
  * lots of innovation in single use sensors, improving aeration, feeding and waste removal
  * pros of single use: reduced time and labor and energy;
  cons: capacity, reliabililty, automatibility, security, waste
  * GE analyzed 5 2000L steel tanks vs 20 500L (!) disposable bioreactors --
  the latter was only 40% cheaper (suprisingly low), required 18% less staff,
  and produced 34% more product
  * only really the best if you're doing 100kg/yr of product in 500L - 1kL reactors
  and if the facility is at 90% utilization (not sure why that is) and if you need to be very flexible
  * Sartorius says there is rising interest in 50L single use system for microbial applications
  * people want more sensors: biomass and CO2

* [challenges in fermentation scalability](http://www.genengnews.com/gen-articles/tackling-the-challenge-of-scalability/5755/?kwrd=bioreactor)
  * a review of eppendorf's product line -- they have autoclavable, sterilize-in-place (SIP) and single-use designs
  * critical to reproduce bioprocess params at each scale to maintain yield
  * they examined vessel and impeller geometry, tip speed, mixing time, oxygen transfer rate,
  impeller power number
  * with mammalian cells and stem cells especially, you have to be careful with tip speed
  or you could shear the cells -- but then in bigger volumes you may need to mix a lot more
  * good notes on testing mix rates, OTR and impeller power number

* [Apr 2016 article on singlue use innovation](http://www.genengnews.com/gen-articles/innovation-continues-in-single-use/5734/?kwrd=bioreactor)
  * strong research interest in single use and continuous flow
  * people in the industry think a facility that only uses disposables is coming



### small scale
* my friend Will made this awesome instructable on an algae bioreactor,
[Farma](http://www.instructables.com/id/Farma-an-at-home-bioreactor-for-pharmaceutical-dru/).
* [Sunny Allen's Biomonstaaar](http://www.instructables.com/id/Biomonstaaar/)
is another algae bioreactor from BioCurious.


### medium scale

* Nov 2014 [article about Lygos](http://m.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/Life-science-startups-find-new-life-in-used-5920679.php):
  * they got $1M of equipment for $150k
  * they've gotten 32 bioreactors together, according to their own press note
  * Cal Institute for Quantitative Bioscience, QB3, has shared facilities
* [Lygos presentation, Mar 2015](http://energy.gov/sites/prod/files/2015/04/f21/biochemical_conversion_steen_0230.pdf)
  * barriers: cost effective production, reduced cycle time for dev (design and construction tools)
  * issues with translating small scale experiments to "relevant fermentation process"
  * one goal: expand workflow capacity


### industrial scale
* the GE "FlexFactory" with bioreactors of various sizing
and other industrial equipment -- more for when you're scaling up an operation I suppose.
This is from their 2011 Xcellerex acquisition, though this vid is from mid-2014.
The software could use an upgrade.

### companies in this space..there are so many
* Pierre Guerin Technologies
* New Brunswick Scientific -- BioFlow 610
* GE Healthcare Life Sciences -- makers of the Wave platform (single use)
* Sartorius
* Applikon -- miniBio
* Electrolabtech.co.uk
* Cercell
* Fisher Scientific
* Danaher-Pall
* [PBS Biotech](http://www.pbsbiotech.com/store/c1/Featured_Products.html)
* Cellexus -- here is their single-use reactor at work:
