The NYT has [an article](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/29/us/politics/obama-legal-authorization-osama-bin-laden-raid.html)
about the legal justification for the May 2011 Abbottabad raid that resulted in the death of bin Laden.

Four federal lawyers wrote several memos that explained the legal basis for the raid itself,
the killing of bin Laden and his burial at sea.
The CIA's general counsel, Stephen Preston,
noted that it was important to have the memos before the raid took place
"particularly if the operation goes terribly badly."

Pakistan had previously assisted on other US govt raids,
but this was such an important target,
and there were concerns that elements of the Pakistani military were harboring bin Laden,
so one memo had to justify violating Pakistani sovereignty
and conducting the raid without permission.
The legal team also seemed to think the executive branch
would violate no domestic law if, during a covert action,
international law was breached.

The lawyers determined that killing bin Laden as the default option was also legal.
A secondhand source made it clear it would be near-impossible
for bin Laden to surrender during the raid.
That bin Laden would be killed was such a foregone conclusion
that there were no firm plans for dealing with any prisoners that might be taken by the SEAL team.

It was overall a depressing thing to see these cynical conclusions laid out.
This was a raid on the government's biggest single enemy,
but it still feels like a bad precedent.
