things I've made in the past, and things I'd like to make some day

<!--more-->

#### things I've made

* my first attempt at turkey was via [this recipe](http://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1015474-simple-roast-turkey)
and I usually hate this particular kind of bird, but I loved the result here
* we also made [mushroom-bacon stuffing](http://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1015422-two-way-stuffing-with-mushrooms-and-bacon),
quite tasty -- cut the bread small and make sure it doesn't get too dry
* this [sour cream crust](http://www.simplyrecipes.com/m/recipes/sour_cream_pie_crust/)
was the best part of my homemade pumpkin pie
* my sister made this [squash cashew soup](http://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1014339-creamy-cashew-butternut-squash-soup) --
very nice
* this [bread recipe](http://www.food.com/recipe/quick-yeast-bread-89164)
was very straightforward and quick -- tasted good and had a nice crust
* quick, pan-fried [citrus chicken](http://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/12240-citrus-chicken)
from Mark Bittman.  It was indeed fast and easy,
the sauce was maybe not as tasty as I would've liked.
* [espresso chili](http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/Black-Bean-and-Espresso-Chili-107639) --
used to make this all the time.  The recipe as listed makes a /ton/ of food.
* [baked sweet potatoes](http://empoweredsustenance.com/bake-a-sweet-potato/)
* [bittman's polenta](http://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1013040-creamy-polenta-with-parmesan-and-sausage)
-- I've tried other polenta recipes but this one is milk-less, which I think is an advantage.
I like to add sauteed mushrooms.
* I love this [chimichurri recipe](http://www.food.com/recipe/chimichurri-21151)
* my sister and I made this [matzo brittle](http://smittenkitchen.com/blog/2009/04/chocolate-caramel-crackers/) --
scary good
* [carrot cake](http://allrecipes.com/recipe/7402/carrot-cake-iii/)
* [rum punch](http://allrecipes.com/recipe/32349/caribbean-rum-punch/) --
but I used Sunny D and pumpking pie spice :|


#### things that look interesting

* [ecuadorean cuisine](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/22/magazine/small-country-many-tastes.html)
(sans guinea pigs `:|`) -- includes seafood and plaintains, meat and cheese potato cakes,
and tuna stew
* [soy sauce cured eggs](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/29/magazine/drinking-food.html)
* [diy jerky](http://www.instructables.com/id/Start-Your-Beef-Jerky-Addiction-Today/?ALLSTEPS)
-- the dehydrator could make other camping food
