The CHM had Stephen Wolfram talk on his biography and,
incidentally, a history of Mathematica.

<!--more-->

* ipython took a lot from the wolfram language's interactive demos..still cool though,
dynamic edge detection didn't draw too much applause though, hah,
maybe old hat for this audience..
* hand drawn lunar orbiter..cool
* truly a kid inspired by the space program..a living, breathing example
* he sent in a paper called hadronic electrons?  At what age?
* he just posed scientific questions and found the answers in books or on his own
* early user of computer algebra, possibly the largest in '76 --
would devise huge formulae in his papers with MACSYMA
* known for cellular automata, particle physics
* Caltech PhD at 20
* started working on his own symbolic manipulation language, SMP
    * told by Rob Pike to use C, "the lang of the future"
    * encrypted the source and lost the pw...lol, they recently broke it recently with crowdsourcing
    * ran it for us live in a vacs emulator
    * it's very similar to Mathematica -- ASCII graphics, random expression generators
* worked with Sutomo shimoro
* started Mathematica at Urbana Champaign
    * Steve jobs insisted on the name "Mathematica" over omega
    * contends that TBL's group at CERN bought NeXT machines to use Mathematica --
    and TBL used those machines later for a networking experiment..
    * for 10.5 yrs Wolfram used Mathematica for basic research, working as a self described hermit CEO
    * cool story of an American aboard MIR, Dr. Mike Foale,
    using Mathematica to analyze the tumbling space station --
    detailed further [here](http://www.wolfram.com/mathematica/customer-stories/astronaut-places-a-customer-service-call-to-wolfram-research-from-space-station-mir.html)
* finished "A New Kind of Science" book and he came back to his company to work more on the tech --
incidentally many Amazon reviewers find that books insufferable :/
* the company used Wolfram tones, cellular automata to create ringtones --
hah, even internally they thought it was silly
* Launched WolframAlpha via Justin.TV cause they were worried live visitors would crash the site
* WA powered Siri for a while.. Bing too
* Sergey interned there..advocated giving software away
* wants to get Wolfram lang into financial prod systems
* Mathematica used in LIGO, proof of Kepler conjecture
(although [this page](http://mathworld.wolfram.com/KeplerConjecture.html) suggests it's incomplete),
AdSense algo, Skype codec..
* Emerald Cloud Lab uses Wolfram language behind the scenes
* rule 30 of a cellular automata -- the chaotic triangle, very cool to experiment with
* A single page of axioms can describe most of math..and 3M theorems --
what are standard axioms, sheffer axioms, basic axioms?
* 3M person years of work, that's math.. Lots of duplication too, he says
