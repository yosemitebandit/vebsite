The LIGO team today announced they have positively identified a gravitational wave --
an amazing discovery.  The livestream:

* 1.3 billion light years away, two black holes coalesced and produced a 10^-21
peak strain in two of the LIGO detectors --
the deflection itself was,
according to [this post](https://lobste.rs/s/qn26iy/ligo_detects_gravitational_waves_from_the_merger_of_two_black_holes),
about 10^-18 m, or about the size of a hydrogen nucleus
* they detected a signal at the Livingston, Louisiana site (?)
and then, 7ms later, the same signal at the Hanford, WA detector
* they know it's a black hole merger
because the signal aligns so well with a numerical model of such an event
* see Physical Review Letters for the paper
* whoa, the frequency of these waves is in the human hearing range, cool --
they shifted it in frequency and it sounds like a bubble popping underwater
* these gravitational waves are strains in space and move at the speed of light,
as predicted by Einstein.
He actually did some back of the envelope math to examine these ideas further,
but concluded no detector could be built for empirical validation
* since Einstein, astronomers have found compact objects to observe
(neutron stars and these binary black holes)
and the detectors have gotten far more precise
* the mirrors and lenses in the sensors are suspended  to handle Earth's vibrations
* Kip Thorne worked on this too -- he was the science advisor for *Interstellar*
* during the 20ms of the collision the power output was
50 times greater than the power output of all of the suns of the universe..wow.
The energy output was what you would get if you annihilated 3 suns and turned them into gravitational waves.
* Kip points out that past views into the universe were exclusively electromagnetic,
so he expects we might find even more interesting things
