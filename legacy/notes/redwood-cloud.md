This was one of the last projects I made while working at
[Redwood Systems](http://redwoodsystems.com).
Redwood collects a huge amount of highly-resolved sensor data
and this not-so-cleverly-named project aggregated the data on a 'cloud' platform.

I built a backend storage system with MongoDB and created an API
and some authentication mechanisms for sending and receiving the data.
I also created the [flask-based](http://flask.pocoo.org/) frontend for viewing reports --
it's demoed in the video below.

A shorter, more 'promo-ish' video might still be up at
[redwoodcloud.com](https://redwoodcloud.com).
But since leaving Redwood in early December 2011, I no longer work on that site.
