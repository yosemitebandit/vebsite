I'm reading his open letter,
[Blowing the Whistle on the UCB Mathematics](http://alexandercoward.com/BlowingTheWhistleOnUCBerkeleyMathematics.html).

* Coward is widely praised by students for his skill as a lecturer, yet he is being fired
* others in the dept have asked him to "align more with our standards" wrt to teaching --
Coward asserts this is the dept's way of asking him to stop making them look bad
* he writes about formative assessment which is the practice
of using assessments to improve students' learning and abilities --
think of qualitative feedback on an exam rather than merely receiving a score.
He provides [this example](http://alexandercoward.com/beforeandafter.pdf)
as a before/after in support of formative assessment.
* and then an element of conspiracy (which I love):
math depts don't bring in much grant money (compared to experimental sciences, for instance),
so to justify their existence they teach prereq classes for many other depts.
UCB Math, for instance, teaches 15k students per year and thereby justifies its size.
Student feedback typically comes back poor for these classes
and UCB Math asks for more money to improve outcomes.
So when Coward came in as a dedicated lecturer and got rave reviews,
he destroyed that older premise that students just weren't that into math.
* will be interesting to see a UCB response..

During a strike at Cal, Coward also wrote an [email to his students](http://alumni.berkeley.edu/california-magazine/just-in/2014-09-02/cal-lecturers-email-students-goes-viral-why-i-am-not)
that is worth reading:

* "You need to optimize your life for learning.
You need to live and breath your education.
You need to be *obsessed* with your education."
