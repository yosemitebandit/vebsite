Aquaya is a small nonprofit research and consulting group
that works with water service providers around the world.
I was there from February 2012 to February 2013,
primarily focusing on their information communication and technology initiatives.

When I joined Aquaya, I began working on Aquatest,
a program that studied the use of mobile phones for collecting water quality data in rural areas.
At the time, many of the organizations we worked with were successfully *providing* water,
but they were struggling to measure water quality, especially in rural areas.
Aquatest was a pilot program that combined a portable microbial testing system
with the use of various mobile phone apps to get data from the remote test sites back to HQ.
We interviewed teams using these systems in Mozambique, Vietnam and Cambodia.
Here's an operator that worked with Teuk Saat, our Cambodian partner.

Teuk Saat had an especially interesting dilemma --
many of the old school phones we were trying to work with couldn't support Khmer glyphs,
so the text on their data collection apps had to be in English.
Many operators just memorized the positions of responses on the screens of their phones,
but this was clearly not ideal..
I worked on [IVRHub](/ivrhub), a system that enabled voice-based Q&A for data collection,
hoping it would allow managers and operators to use whatever language they preferred,
but we sadly never tested it with real customers.

We later worked more with our partners in Vietnam (HueWaco) and Mozambique (UNICEF)
to build an open source business intelligence system.
Initially, many of their water quality records were kept on paper and their measurements were compiled manually.
We wanted to change that so they could gather more data and compile reports more easily.
To this end I built [Pipeline](/pipeline), a flexible system for data collection and aggregation.
We went through a lot of iterations with our clients
and it was very gratifying building something that improved their data collection and analysis capabilities.
