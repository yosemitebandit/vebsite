:computer: [JSFree.org](https://jsfree.org)
- this gave me some inspiration for the css of my site
- but I'm not this dogmatic about a js-less web,
I guess it could affect site accessibilty.
I have several friends who work on this, I should ask them.
There are [detailed standards for web accessibilty](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/quickref/?versions=2.1)
(outside of just js)
and tools like [`axe-core`](https://github.com/dequelabs/axe-core) can check compliace

:cloud: [DNSSEC](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/dns/dns-security/)
- easy enough to turn this on with most registrars, I wonder why it's not the default?
- not sure what DNS tunneling is: "Attackers can use SSH, TCP, or HTTP to pass malware or stolen information into DNS queries"
- spoofing/hijacking makes sense.. the other listed vectors are also interesting variations on ddos
- DNSSEC is just signing all the requests back to the root,
with a [cool irl signing ceremony](https://www.cloudflare.com/dns/dnssec/root-signing-ceremony/) to cover the root zone.
This reminds me of a [Radiolab episode about a signing ceremony](https://radiolab.org/podcast/ceremony)
..ah but that was a crypto project.
Deeper review of DNSSEC [here](https://blog.cloudflare.com/dnssec-an-introduction/)
- I'll turn it on, seems like the downsides are what you'd expect:
more overhead with parsing the requests and support is not universal,
not relevant for my micro site but interesting to learn about

:scientist: [NYT: Arena BioWorks](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/12/business/arena-bioworks-scientists-harvard-mit.html)
- various funders are directly backing a research group aimed at broad drug discovery
- not a lot here on what they'll pursue or detail on how they're structured;
there's a lot of whinging about diverting investments away from universities
and poaching PIs and scientists from academia
- their [press release](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/arena-bioworks-launches-as-a-privately-funded-fully-independent-biomedical-institute-to-shorten-the-path-from-insight-to-therapeutics-302033563.html)
says the model "empowers scientists to investigate any disease"
and, after locking in on a mechanism, they'll form companies to pursue things further

:ru: Gentleman in Moscow
- listened to this one via Libby
- it's quite ponderous, should I have just listened to a real Russian novel??

:scotland: The Scottish Play
- I listened to two productions on Libby,
the one from BBC2 is really great
- I spoke with ChatGPT about the different scenes and background (fairly helpful),
and I also did some [Anki](@/notes/anki.md) decks on quotes and themes and this was really fun (Happiness!!)
