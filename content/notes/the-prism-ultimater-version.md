My friend [Trevor](http://trevorshp.com) and I
built a one-sheet boat using plans from the famous [Hannu](http://koti.kapsi.fi/hvartial/oss2/oss2.htm).
All you need is a lone sheet of birch plywood (3/8" I think..),
some 1x2 runners for support and fiberglass for the outer seams where the flat bottom meets the sides.
The inner seams were covered with a thickened resin. The outside has a few coats of Tung oil.

Hannu's 'ultimater' version of the Prism has some stability enhancements and can theoretically displace 800 lbs.
But we got a little nervous with three people inside --
the freeboard gets to be quite low and if you're not all carefully balanced, the bow or stern can swamp.

We have lots more [pictures](https://plus.google.com/photos/104532315857990767595/albums/5833521596572962657)
of our various excursions into the Bay,
including Trevor's excellent [timelapse](https://plus.google.com/photos/104532315857990767595/albums/5833521596572962657/5843564031949934738).
The boat seems to handle South Bay waters just fine, and we're tentatively discussing a journey to the East Bay,
probably following the narrowing along the Dumbarton Bridge..
