My buddy [Will](http://iamwillpatrick.com) and I
did a short trip on the John Muir Trail in the Sierras.
We camped near Florence Lake -- right here actually:
[37.2324891N, -118.8780362W](https://www.google.com/maps/place/37°13'57.0"N+118°52'39.0"W).
I remember because we camped right near that logjam north of the river.

We were going to cross the San Joaquin to look for the hotsprings on the other side,
but Will saw a brown bear the first night..
it was eating a deer right at the other end of the logjam bridge.
The river was really cranking so we don't think it heard us,
but when I got closer it started sniffing around and loped off into the woods.
It came back a few minutes later and dragged off the rest of its deer jerky.
We saw him again the next morning and decided the bear could enjoy the hotsprings on his own.
I tried getting a picture with my disposable camera but I guess it didn't come out --
they never sent me any bear pics back and so I'll never have proof, alas.

Had a great time all around -- we swam in Florence Lake for all of 30s,
it was freezing with the runoff from Memorial Day snow.
We saw another fellow hiking with skis on his back --
he had just come from some spring skiing at Selden Pass.

Another guy we met was hiking (and promoting) the National Hot Springs Trail.
Nice dude..also a total machine.. capable of 30mi days, it was his 33rd day on the trail.
His route was so cool, he'd hit a different hot spring almost every single day,
from Santa Barbara through Nevada and Idaho to Montana.
We gave him some blueberries and carrots, he was too antsy to wait for the ferry with us
and he set off to hike around the lake.
