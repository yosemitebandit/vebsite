This is a Mac app written in Swift.
It's a pomodoro timer,
every successful "session" you get a random addition to your digital forest.

Behold my somewhat lopsided forest:

{{ resize_image(path="projects/bosque/screenshot.png", width=500, height=500, op="fit_width") }}

I've used an app like this on android and I thought it would be fun to have one on my mac.

I built this leaning _heavily_ on Gemini.
I don't know app development principles, nor Swift,
and the copy-pasting from Gemini to Xcode got pretttty old..
I should try things like `copilot.vim` to have more direct integration.

To get this in the App Store is $99.. annually.. 
and that's too much, so the app developer journey ends here!
The code is, and a release of the app if you want to try it:
