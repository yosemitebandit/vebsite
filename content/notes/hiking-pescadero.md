I had a very nice walk around [Pescadero Creek SP](http://parks.smcgov.org/pescadero-creek-park-trails)
after a week of rain.
From the Tarwater Trailhead I took the Tarwater Trail Loop west and then south to the camp --
it was quite swampy down there.
Of six sites I think two were kinda nice.
And you could sorta rappel down to the creek which might be nice in the summer.
I returned via the Pomponio Ridge and Upper Coyote Ridge trails, about six miles total.
Took me about 2hrs 45min, I believe.

There was a curious abandoned cabin..maybe from loggers?

Many trees had come down recently.

The grasses along the trails were beautiful though.

And you could look down into the valley to see the fog.
