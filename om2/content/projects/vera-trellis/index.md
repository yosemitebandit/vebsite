We have jasmine in some diy redwood planters built along the garage.
This is my third attempt at entraining them --
first jute twine, then nylon. Both were vertical and didn't work that well.
The lines should be mostly horizontal!

Here is how it looked after a year or so of trying to grow straight up.
I think the beds need more compost and some other tweaks to watering too.
Well to be fair that section in the corner near the door is doing great,
I think it gets the most water and a bit less sun..
and perhaps has more bits to grab onto being near a downspout.

I saw a video building a trellis using
[M6 eyebolts from Muzata](https://amazon.com/dp/B08FB5HSV3), they're about 75Â¢ each,
and metal wire with tensioners.
I figured fishing wire could work too so that's what I went with:
easier to cut and no tensioners needed.
It's rated for 48lbs.

I aimed for studs at first but kept missing them..
thankfully the bolts felt quite sturdy in just the siding.
So eventually I just followed the pattern I wanted and didn't keep to 16" OC.

We'll check back next year to see how it does!
