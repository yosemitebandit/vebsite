Loved this review by
[Ilana Teitelbaum](http://www.amazon.com/review/ROUPGG431IT15/ref=cm_cr_dp_title?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0312282990&nodeID=283155&store=books)

Think I still gave it four stars on goodreads, though.

> The theme of art and its relationship with escapism is the one theme that threads consistently throughout the novel.
Otherwise, one might say that “Kavalier and Clay,” for all its strong points,
is lacking in that after the tight, virtuoso beginning,
the story loses focus and eventually all sense of unity.
The plot becomes somewhat convoluted in the manner of John Irving,
as if Chabon is throwing oddities into the mix just to keep things interesting.
Hence we get Antarctica, the oddball marriage,
and the threatened jump from the Empire State Building,
which feel as if they are taking place in a world apart from the rich world
to which we were originally introduced as readers, which was in itself so compelling.
The result is that one begins to wonder where the original story went,
if this is the same book,
and to wish that it had ended before the pure magic of the atmosphere became replaced with coincidence and contrived circumstance.
