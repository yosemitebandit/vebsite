Me and some friends worked on a car for [Sparkfun's Autonomous Vehicle Competition](http://avc.sparkfun.com).
The race has your car make one (just one!) lap around a haybale-bordered track in Sparkfun HQ's parking lot.
There are dirt sections, hoops to go through, barrels to dodge, jumps, zigzags
and the famous "discombobulator" -- a spinning disc that most competitors just try to jump if they approach it at all.

Our entry, "Neural Carputer," used a four layer convolutional neural network
that was trained on a single front-facing camera and the car's odometer.
We took about an hour of training data --
I just manually drove the car through the course during the practice time before race day.
In autonomous mode, Carputer would eventually make one perfect run around the course
and have many more less-than-perfect runs too (:

*the hardware*

![carputer hardware](/img/carputer-hardware.png)

Carputer's raced in three AVCs now and the hardware's evolved over the years..
one arduino takes RC input data, another arduino sends servo commands, and in between..
a Macbook Pro retina with an Nvidia GPU running our control software, haha.
The Macbook is definitely overkill but it lets us take data, train, update and test very quickly.

The chassis is an RC car that we exteneded to accomodate the laptop.
Our camera is mounted into the plastic body of the car.
We use a 3S lipo but stay far away from the car's 60mph+ max speed.
There was once a lidar in the mix but we couldn't quite get that working the way we wanted.


*the software*

We'll post it soon --
it uses [tensorflow](https://tensorflow.org) and a bunch of pre- and post-processing scripts.


*our autonomous runs on the Sparkfun course*

Our first test run in the early morning light was amazing -- it completed a full lap,
only lightly grazing a barrier on the backstretch.
Here's what the car sees, in jawdropping 160 x 120 resolution.
We've overlayed the steering and throttle settings, as well as the odo measurements.

We had trained that particular model during the drive to the track
after applying two new ideas the night before.
We were really pumped about the car's morning performance but,
sadly, this would be our best run of the day..

We competed in three official heats:
the first heat had our car roll forward with great promise for about 3m and then promptly hit the brakes.
It sat there stubbornly until the judges made us clear the track.

Our logs showed that the remote override had been activated --
something we usually employ to prevent really spectacular crashes.
I had been holding the RC transmitter, but I didn't think I had hit our e-stop button.
We later saw this happen during other test runs and attributed it to RF voodoo magic --
there were a lot of other transmitters in the vicinity.
After commenting out our remote kill switch code, we got ready for the next races..

Our second heat was the most exciting run I saw from any car --
Carputer fought through several haybales, hellbent on getting through the dirt,
and then it took an unplanned turn towards the discombobulator..

{{% video "/misc/avc-2016-heat-two.mp4" %}}

As usual, the discombobulator won (:
We nearly got very lucky and had the car right itself
*and* point in the right direction -- it might have done ok if it had tipped a bit more.
Or if Otavio had danced a bit harder, haha.

Our final official race was quite anticlimatic --
we had added a throttle hack to try and slow down just for the first turn..
that, a new untested model, and some camera white balance issues
left us driving uncertainly towards an SFE videographer and then into a haybale.

Hm, it also looks like our steering trim is way off after crashing so much during the day --
we're sending "89" to the steering, just one away from neutral, but we're drifting way left.
Compare that to the 89 we send in the first video..

We also had the car race for fun in the multi-car rumble --
it gets a lot of human assistance on those laps (:

I'm sure Sparkfun will do an AVC wrapup video sometime soon,
hopefully Carputer makes it in there.


*various tricks that helped us this year*

We "class balanced" our network by tossing 70% of training data
that just had the car going straight-ish -- this allowed the network to learn more from turns.
It helped make up for the fact that most of the driving is on straightaways

Our odometer wasn't the fanciest, and we only had one of them, so we were worried about drift.
To counteract this we binned our odo data to effectively divide the track into segments.
Our hope was that the car would use this info about its rough position on the track
to augment its perception of certain images.


*next year*

* learn about how to avoid RC interference
* figure out white balancing issues
* trim the steering more often
* reattach the lidar and get that working (:


*other racers*

This fellow hand-built his hall-effect odometer system
with alternating neodinium magnets on the inside of each wheel.. amazing:

"Two Potatoe" was cleaning up out there -- it completed all three of its runs
at a respectable pace with no fuss.

This guy was up late with us during the practice session,
making a map in the dark with his scanning lidar.
