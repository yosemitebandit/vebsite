Went to Joshua Tree with some friends this last weekend --
scrambling around Skull Rock and Hidden Valley was really fun.

We saw the Queen Valley Mine and hiked around Ryan Mountain and Black Rock Canyon --
it's a really cool place, would love to go back, there's so much to explore..

On the way home we went by a soaring school near Mojave, CA.
Nearby is one of the world's biggest wind farms,
and soaring records have been set in the vicinity as well.
We saw a friend's hand-built glider:

Would be fun to try sometime, maybe I'll just get a little RC plane for now (:
