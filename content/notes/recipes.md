things I've made in the past, and things I'd like to make some day

<!--more-->

#### things I've made

* my first attempt at turkey was via [this recipe](http://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1015474-simple-roast-turkey)
and I usually hate this particular kind of bird, but I loved the result here
* we also made [mushroom-bacon stuffing](http://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1015422-two-way-stuffing-with-mushrooms-and-bacon),
quite tasty -- cut the bread small and make sure it doesn't get too dry
* this [sour cream crust](http://www.simplyrecipes.com/m/recipes/sour_cream_pie_crust/)
was the best part of my homemade pumpkin pie
* my sister made this [squash cashew soup](http://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1014339-creamy-cashew-butternut-squash-soup) --
very nice
* this [bread recipe](http://www.food.com/recipe/quick-yeast-bread-89164)
was very straightforward and quick -- tasted good and had a nice crust.
The crust will get brown at about minute twenty,
but you can press on bake for another ten or twenty minutes.
We've probably made 20+ loaves of this..it's a staple!
* quick, pan-fried [citrus chicken](http://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/12240-citrus-chicken)
from Mark Bittman.  It was indeed fast and easy,
the sauce was maybe not as tasty as I would've liked.
* [espresso chili](http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/Black-Bean-and-Espresso-Chili-107639) --
used to make this all the time.  The recipe as listed makes a /ton/ of food.
* [baked sweet potatoes](http://empoweredsustenance.com/bake-a-sweet-potato/)
* [bittman's polenta](http://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1013040-creamy-polenta-with-parmesan-and-sausage)
-- I've tried other polenta recipes but this one is milk-less, which I think is an advantage.
I like to add sauteed mushrooms.
* I love this [chimichurri recipe](http://www.food.com/recipe/chimichurri-21151)
* my sister and I made this [matzo brittle](http://smittenkitchen.com/blog/2009/04/chocolate-caramel-crackers/) --
scary good
* [carrot cake](http://allrecipes.com/recipe/7402/carrot-cake-iii/)
* [rum punch](http://allrecipes.com/recipe/32349/caribbean-rum-punch/) --
but I used Sunny D and pumpking pie spice :|
* [broccolini with garlic](http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/ina-garten/sauteed-broccolini-and-garlic-recipe.html)
* [salsa / pico de gallo](http://allrecipes.com/recipe/16542/salsa/)
* [bittman's pancakes](http://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1893-everyday-pancakes) --
doubled the recipe and (consequently?) found these to be a bit bland
* [oatmeal chocolate chip cookies](http://www.kingarthurflour.com/recipes/chocolate-chip-oatmeal-cookies-recipe) --
didn't exactly follow the recipe for want of the right kind of sugar and a way to measure butter..
they were ok
* [couscous with cilantro](http://www.food.com/recipe/couscous-with-fresh-cilantro-and-lemon-juice-505110) --
quick and pretty good!  Added much more cilantro and turmeric.
* [oven-baked cod](http://www.food.com/recipe/easy-oven-baked-cod-133718) --
we used Dover Sole, lime and cilantro -- still very flaky and tasty
* [parmesan cream crackers](http://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1012655-parmesan-cream-crackers) --
tasty!
* [katherine hepburn's brownies](http://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/10782-katharine-hepburns-brownies) --
the best.  Good with walnuts, haven't tried pecans.  Used a few pinches of salt (not just one)
* [potato tart](http://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1016882-savory-potato-tart) --
came out well but yeah, it's a tough one to make, takes a while..
* [oatmeal](http://ambertheblack.com/how-to-make-oatmeal/) -- 3 parts liquid to 2 parts oats
* [salad lyonnaise](http://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1013180-salade-lyonnaise) -- very nice, a hearty meal
* sweet potato quesadillas and Brazilian onion salsa from the Moosewood cookbook --
lots of grating and chopping, but they were a good combo!
* also from Moosewood, the espresso / mascarpone / brandy pudding (mousse?) was very nice,
but the gorgonzola / cream cheese / hazelnut dip was less of a hit (though not a bad spread)
* [pan-fried chicken breasts](http://www.food.com/recipe/simple-pan-fried-chicken-breasts-91587) +
the deglazing suggested in the comments, pretty good!
* gotta find better ways to make acorn squash -- have tried a few recipes that seem christmas-themed,
both left something to be desired..maybe should do more soups like the one my sister made above
* [pineapple salsa with jicama](http://www.simplyrecipes.com/recipes/pineapple_salsa_with_jicama/) --
really nice and fresh!
* [guacamole with serrano peppers](http://www.simplyrecipes.com/recipes/perfect_guacamole/) --
it's all about good avocados
* artichoke dip -- we made this with mayo, cream cheese, canned artichokes, garlic, dill, salt and a few almonds (!)
* [fresh ricotta](http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/fresh-homemade-ricotta-234282) --
verdict is still out, but use a really big pot if you can
* [mushroom + bacon pie](http://allrecipes.com/recipe/88086/mushroom-pie/) -- tasty and pretty straightforward
* [puff pastry](http://www.dessertfortwo.com/15-minute-puff-pastry/) -- came out absurdly wet with all that water,
but eventually worked out ok..I think


#### things that look interesting

* [ecuadorean cuisine](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/22/magazine/small-country-many-tastes.html)
(sans guinea pigs `:|`) -- includes seafood and plaintains, meat and cheese potato cakes,
and tuna stew
* [soy sauce cured eggs](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/29/magazine/drinking-food.html)
* [diy jerky](http://www.instructables.com/id/Start-Your-Beef-Jerky-Addiction-Today/?ALLSTEPS)
-- the dehydrator could make other camping food
* a [tagine](http://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1016987-daniel-bouluds-chicken-tagine)
