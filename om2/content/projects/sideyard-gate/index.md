### Our gate was busted!

The hinges and fasteners aren't quite right on the wooden side.
The hinges might also be mis-aligned.
Also the brace is backwards.
The stucco wall on the left seems to have cinderblock underneath
and the fasteners in there are mostly tight.
The bolting latch is also no good, too easy to get stuck,
and we'd like to be able to open it from the outside, which we currently cannot!

### Inspiration, Measurements, Design

I really liked this style from [Julian Hodges](https://www.finehomebuilding.com/2007/07/01/in-the-golden-gates-shadow),
with the recessed slats and curved top and thicker base.
But how to curve the top..
This group in LA, ATD Gates, made this cool square design, evocative!

Ultimately I decided to redo the whole thing, including the hinges.
I took some measurements and thought about moving our large compost bin through the opening..

I made a design, got to looking at lumber and couldn't find what I wanted, so I redrew the plans at the store.
A redwood frame with thin slats to cover the front in an arch,
diagonal pattern to the slats for more cut-efficiency
based on the lengths I was getting at the store and fitting in my car.
Fasteners: I nearly talked myself into doing a hidden fastener system so that the front surface could be really clean..
I had big thoughts about custom clips or knock-off cheap clips..and the dados I'd have to cut somehow..I'm glad I didn't do that!
I ultimately just went with trim screws in a nice pattern.
