## Matt Ball | Portfolio

Hello!  My name's Matt -- I'm a hardware and software engineer
interested in biology, robotics and machine learning.
I grew up in North Carolina and have spent the last five years in the Bay Area --
I've had a great time out here working at [two](https://oakmachine.com/vinyl)
[startups](https://oakmachine.com/endaga), a [big company](https://oakmachine.com/project-wing)
and even a [nonprofit](https://oakmachine.com/aquaya).
I love [biking](https://oakmachine.com/rides) and [hiking](https://oakmachine.com/the-john-muir-trail)
from Marin to Henry Coe,
and I love doing the occasional hackathon with friends in this area.

The projects below are some of my favorites --
I think they best capture my interests and capabilities.
If you have any questions or ideas or would like to collaborate on something, let me know!
