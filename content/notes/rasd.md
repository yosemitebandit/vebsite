I spent the better part of the summer in Nkokonjeru working with friends
and the awesome people at the Rural Agency for Sustainable Development.
Led by Ignitius Bwoogi, RASD provides agricultural assistance,
leads local health programs, and offers technical training to the community.
RASD and Ignitius are very well-respected within the community
and this was our group's third year of working with him.

My buddy [Will](http://iamwillpatrick.com) worked for many months
to plan out some of the infrastructure projects
that RASD believed would help the organization make money and better serve the community.
We worked with them during the summer to create a welding and carpentry workshop, classrooms, and a fence.

Ignitius's largest goal was to set up an internet cafe at RASD --
it would be the first in the community
and could provide a steady stream of income to finance RASD's other programs.
I played a small part in helping Will set this up
with solar-powered Inveneo computers and Meraki routers.
I also worked on the biomass charcoal and jatropha bio-fuel projects which can also be found on this site.
