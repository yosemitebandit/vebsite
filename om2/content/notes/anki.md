I'm enjoying Anki --
this is basically an app for memorization via flashcards and spaced repetition.

I'm enjoying the shared decks on
geography (US and international),
architecture,
notable people (those with asteroids named after them),
historical dates,
facts about coffee and wine,
florid vocab,
greek letters,
unit conversions,
plants and trees,
Spanish,
the US constitution,
music (chords, themes, notes)
even [The Scottish Play](@/notes/jan24-reading.md)!

I'd like to build (or find) decks on:
- cheese, more on wine (Zraly book? winefolly?)
- famous scientists and discoveries, Nobel prizes in the sciences
- and personal things,
like the story behind pictures,
or plots of books and movies I've seen,
bdays of friends,
important phone numbers and things like my license plate,
local streets and landmarks and history
(would be cool to have a sw tool to make a deck of N cards about place X)
- quotes, poems, koans, soliloquies
- more people from history like factoids on Aristotle for example
- engineering data, scientific constants, theorems, axioms
- composers, playwrights, authors
- cooking: standard dinners and lunches,
super simple recipes,
target temperatures for things like chicken
- native american tribes and their histories
- ~vim~ -- nvm; but maybe python, SQL
- diseases and their causes and symptoms like MS vs Huntingtons
- puzzles, riddles
- knots
- decimal fractions
- algorithms e.g. ways to integrate
- logic
- mental models (yegg), heuristics, biases
