shows that I recall..

### 2015

* `Here We Go Magic` in November at the Independent in SF --
they disappointed, honestly, but `Big Thief` was great.
* a really nice guitarist at a wedding in Chicago
* `Buddy Guy` in downtown SF -- that guy's hilarious
* `Thao Nguyen and the Get Down Stay Downs` at the Swedish American Music Hall in SF --
was really excited about this but I had to leave to catch the train before Thao came on..
* `Mountain Goats` at the Fillmore -- one of my favorites
* `Gregory Alan Isakov` at the Fillmore -- great sound live

### 2014
* `Worldwide Dance Party` -- a funky show in RWC

### 2013-ish
* `Gillian Welch` and others at the Warren Hellman memorial show at Ocean Beach

### 2012-ish
* `Mountain Goats` at an East Bay Vineyard

### 2010-ish
* `Here We Go Magic` with `Beach House` (er, I think?) as an opener, both were great

### 2008-ish
* `Mountain Goats` at NCSSM


### shows that I missed..

* didn't go see `Sufjan` because the tickets were too expensive,
same with `Jose Gonzalez` (2015)
* my friend got `Beirut` to come to a local coffeeshop
right before his first album blew up, but I didn't go :| (2008-ish)
