I was reading [Scalia's obituary](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/14/us/antonin-scalia-death.html)
in the NYTimes and, of course, getting caught up in his history
and what the nomination of his replacement will entail.

The man's practices are hard to stomach --
his following of "originalism" (an attempt at interpreting the consitution
in a manner similar to that of the document's authors)
led to very conservative outcomes,
but he also famously cast doubt on the theory he championed:
"I am a textualist.  I am an originalist.  I am not a nut."
An author, David A. Strauss, replied, "If following a theory consistently would make you a nut,
isnâ€™t that a problem with the theory?"

He disparaged homosexuals and opposed abortions
on the grounds that they were not "rooted in the traditions of the American people."
He called for a federalist interpretation of the law,
yet sided with the majority to halt Florida's recount in Bush v. Gore.

This distressing reading was alleviated
by the discovery of his close friendship with Ruth Bader Ginsberg.

Which then led me to reading about [the Notorious RBG](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25422234-notorious-rbg)
..might have to pick that one up!
