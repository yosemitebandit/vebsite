I was a Program Associate at Aquaya from February 2012 to February 2013,
working primarily on their new-ish information communication and technology initiatives.

I started working on the Aquatest data collection project.
Aquaya had this really interesting grant to work with small and medium water service providers --
we were trying to help providers better understand the water quality in their systems.
At the time, many of these organizations were successfully providing water,
and in fact they checked off an important Millenium Development Goal.
So there was a new goal set before them to measure and verify the actual quality of the provided water.
And this could be especially tough since providers were
becoming responsible for more and more of the rural areas surrounding main towns,
so more tests were needed from areas that were further away.

Aquaya helped pilot a new microbial testing system,
and also explored the use of various apps to get the data from mobile test sites back to HQ.
We interviewed teams using these systems in Mozambique, Vietnam and Cambodia.
Here's an operator that worked with Teuk Saat, our Cambodian partner.

Teuk Saat had an especially interesting dilemma --
many of the old school phones we were trying to work with couldn't support Khmer glyphs,
so the text on their data collection apps had to be in English.
Many operators just memorized the positions of responses,
but this was clearly not ideal..
I worked on [IVRHub](/ivrhub) to try to enable voice-based questions and responses,
but we sadly never tested it.

We later worked more with our partners in Vietnam (HueWaco) and Mozambique (UNICEF)
to build an open source business intelligence system.
Many of their water quality records were kept as paper and data was compiled manually.
We wanted to change that so they could gather more data and compile reports more easily.
To this end I built [Pipeline](/pipeline), a flexible system for data collection and aggregation.
We went through a lot of iterations with our clients
and it was very gratifying building something they actually used.
