"By trying to be everything to everyone, Uber has lost its recognizability as a brand."
From Eli Schiff's [notes on the Uber redesign](http://www.elischiff.com/blog/2016/2/16/ubers-atomic-meltdown).

I don't know much about "brand science" (is that a thing?)
but his article points out a lot of bad-sounding practices --
micromanagement coupled with prolific and somehow unguided design..
color palletes for everyone..
a radically different logo..

I read elsewhere about their design team -- there are 200 people!
Maybe the rebranding effort was led by a smaller team..
