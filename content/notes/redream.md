I helped build redream.us during a hackathon hosted by GAFFTA and the Tribeca Institute.
Our site takes written memories of dreams and pieces together video montages that evoke the nocturnal experience.

<!--more-->

All of the site's videos are listed by [`@redream_us`](https://twitter.com/redream_us),
so check there to watch the dreams of others.
And make sure to listen to the mixed audio in each compilation --
that's often my favorite part.

This team was really, really great â€“ everyone's listed [here](http://redream.us/about).
We put our code [on github](https://github.com/yosemitebandit/redream),
and the readme goes through more of the technical specifics if you're curious.
