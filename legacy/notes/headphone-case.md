Making a case for my audio-technica ATH-M30 headphones..
mediocre headphones at best, but they get banged around in my bag
which doesn't help things.

Here's a model of the headphones themselves,
I wasn't sure how to best approach this so I started modeling the earpiece,
and then worked around from there.

The headband didn't "close" into a proper semicircle when I mirrored everything --
you can see the little imperfection on the far right.

Here's Keqing making an awesome headphone concept with mostly sculpting tools:

Based on his video, maybe I should've built everything but the headband,
mirrored all that,
and then dragged the headband around in a single, unmirrored arc.
