I attended a nice talk on food preservation at the Mountain View library:

<!--more-->

* The lecturer (Candace?) is a Master Food Preserver --
similar to master gardener designation,
they are connected to extension programs which are themselves connected to land grant schools
(these would be interesting to read more about)
* the seek to be research-based and fight "gramma's way" --
she really stressed that you should only use approved recipes
* preservation is pretty broad -- there's canning, freezing, fermenting, pickling, dehydrating..
* she likes making..
    * ketchup -- very different than store bought, she says.
    Tomato sauce on the other hand, not that different from a good quality store-bought sauce
    * green chiles, hatch variety from NM -- you can make salsas or freeze them and make chile rellenos.
    First you roast them (or get them roasted from Molly Stone's at the end of August).
    * brandied cherries
    * pears in rum
    * quince jelly
    * feijoas
* surpsing preserved things..
    * salmon candy
    * diy canned tuna (pretty good apparently) --
    it's trendy to age it now, or at least there was a New Yorker article about it
    * pickled watermelon rind and pickled pears
    * persian cucumbers for pickles
    * Njera bread is fermented, as is soy sauce -- made with vegetables in a salt brine
    * freezer jams are a thing
* when making acidic foods use a water bath canner (jelly, preserves),
low acid foods need a pressure canned (meat poultry fish, corn)
* can't use a pressure cooker though.. not necessarily airtight and cools too fast
* recommended jars: Ball or Carr, need two part lid --
but don't actually store with the ring on!  This traps moisture.
* when you can the lid should be super tight and won't have that trampoline feel / sound
* also need to follow specific recipe, need acidity in the right neighborhood and need appropriate heat in the bath
* jar will be super hot before it's filled, need them that way so they dont break under heat shock
* quart is the biggest you should go for home canning, fermenting can go bigger
* boiling water better than those steam canners, she thinks
* siphoning happens -- may see some tomato juice in the boiling water
* useful books:
    * So Easy to Preserve
    * The Ball Complete Book of Home Preserving
    * USDA Guide to Home Canning
* useful sites:
    * [UC Cooperative Extension](http://cesanmateo.ucanr.edu)
    * [UC Division of Ag and Natural Resources](http://www.ucanr.edu)
    * [National Center for Home Food Preservation](http://www.nchfp.uga.edu)
    * [Ball](http://www.freshpreserving.com)
    * [USDA](http://www.nifa.usda.gov)
* have to use special salt for fermenting -- kosher or pickling or noniodized sea salt
* can microwave herbs for preservation... Cool
* dipping in ascorbic acid can prevent browning before dehydrating or freezing
* canned food is safe and good for a year, two years is safe but not as tasty
