at the behest of [Doebelli](/2015/thinking-clearly/)
and especially his chapter on ...,
here is a list of beliefs that I hold dear:

<!--more-->


#### education
Should be free through college.
Only PhDs get it right -- highly selective, largely self-guided, paid a stipend (albeit small).
Early education should be more Montessori-style.
Kids should be allowed to explore their interests and be creative.
Too much testing and rote memorization.
The goal should be to develop a kid's sense of curiosity and self-determinism.


#### science
Where it's at.
Our best system for understanding our world and experiences.
So wide-ranging, it makes me sad to hear kids say they don't like it.


#### religion
Don't believe in a god.
Raised a methodist / UU though and I liked that.
Worship and fellowship are great -- just nice big peaceful group meditations.
And the teachings of many religions are excellent.
Pretty interested, actually, in religions from a historical perspective.


#### poverty
Today's extreme national and global income disparity is just culturally embarrassing.
Would like to learn more about the living wage work being proposed in Europe.
Love the Buckminster Fuller quote on work:

> We should do away with the absolutely specious notion that everybody has to
> earn a living. It is a fact today that one in ten thousand of us can make a
> technological breakthrough capable of supporting all the rest. The youth of
> today are absolutely right in recognizing this nonsense of earning a living.
> We keep inventing jobs because of this false idea that everybody has to be employed
> at some kind of drudgery because, according to Malthusian Darwinian theory he must
> justify his right to exist. So we have inspectors of inspectors and people making
> instruments for inspectors to inspect inspectors. The true business of people
> should be to go back to school and think about whatever it was they were thinking
> about before somebody came along and told them they had to earn a living.


#### relationships
I like Dan Savage's advice to be "good, giving and game."


#### family
An unflinching support net that I've been lucky enough to have.


#### speech
Would like to read more about the Charlie Hedbo debate.
The attack on them was of course ludicrous but did they not push the bounds of satire even?


#### government
How can we not worry about it?
Too much historical precedent to do otherwise.
I remember my dad talking about Germany in the early 20th century,
it was one of the world's most culturally advanced nations full of extremely intelligent people.
We've let some bad things happen as citizens of this country and should take care.


#### art and expression
Still reading Sontag, I really like it.
Absolutely need more of it in my life.
Working with computers all day, I begin to feel more like a machine.


#### drugs
Never tried em, which I find embarrassing to say..
But I've got no problem with people voluntarily doing things to their own bodies..
The harder stuff gives me pause because it seems to be a pretty clear path to self-destruction
and seems to often harm others.
But the world is full of such things :/
