Saw this [press release](https://news.osu.edu/news/2015/10/29/vfaweld/)
and [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CB2QnbSfmw0)
on a new kind of welding -- VFAW.

Dissimilar metal pairs are joined by being rammed together at very high speeds.
This is often done with explosives,
but in VFAW they pass something like 8kJ through a piece of aluminum foil,
subliming the foil and propelling one metal into another.  Pretty cool!
Jump to 5:10 in that video above to see them press go, as it were.
The distinctive, um-scale wave pattern at the interface of the two metals is also neat to see --
it comes about because of the turbulent flow of the two materials.
