I've been reading about Adimab, a NH company that makes an antibody discovery platform.
This [March 2016 Wired article](http://www.wired.com/2016/03/mutant-yeast-cranking-pharmas-next-superdrug/)
details their work in yeast:

<!--more-->

* they have a "synthetic human immune system" in the yeast
via ~30 modifications to the yeast's genome
* this allows the yeast (a fungus) to make human proteins
* Adimab has made 10B antibodies of unknown utility --
they allow pharma companies to bring in target antigens
and they see which yeast can make antibodies that attack these antigens.
  * for scale, a single human's immune system can produce about 100M unique antibodies)
  * also recall that humans make antibodies and fight disease with a similar method --
  it's a bit random, bizarrely, B-cells just crank out antibodies
  and other processes in the immune system determine what works
* five of these antibodies have now moved on to clinical therapeutic trials
(Adimab was founded in 2007)

A team from Scripps used the platform to screen for Ebola antibodies,
their [2016 Science paper is here](http://science.sciencemag.org/content/351/6277/1078.full).

* 349 mAbs were isolated from a convalescent donor who survived the 2014 EBOV Zaire outbreak
* they found 77% of the antibodies neutralized live EBOV
* therapeutic tests:
  * mice were first challenged with EBOV
  * given a 100ug dose of antibodies after two days
  * 60-100% of mice survived
  * only 40% of mice survived in the control group (treated with another antibody)
