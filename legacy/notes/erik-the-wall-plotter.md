Inspired by several other vertical wall-plotters we saw online,
my buddy [Will](http://iamwillpatrick.com/) and I built Erik, a drawing robot.

It uses two stepper motors to pull a pen around a canvas.
But the pen cannot be lifted!
So there are some interesting path-generation challenges.
The software that interfaces with the controller board was written by us and it's available
[on github](https://github.com/yosemitebandit/erik).
