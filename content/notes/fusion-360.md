I just learned that Fusion 360 is free for "enthusiasts" --
it's an excellent modeling program.
I tried 123D Design and had issues with it on mac.
In the past I've used Sketchup, OpenSCAD and, to a limited extent, Solidworks and FreeCAD,
but Fusion 360 is my favorite of the bunch.

* components are containers for bodies -- they're bound by their own degrees of freedom
and maintain their own origins and reference planes
* joints are used to govern positioning and motion of assembly components --
as-built joints can be used to setup how parts should move in relation to each other
once the thing is actually created
* the timeline is really cool -- editing old sketches is super easy
* sculpting is also a cool mode that I had not seen before --
see the bike seat video below.  You can create more organic things in a free-form way.
* the patch workspace seems to be for creating surfaces,
as opposed to the model workspace which creates solid geometries
* there's some discussion on parameteric vs direct modeling --
it seems like parametric is what I'm used to from Solidworks:
defining variables and basing designs off of other surfaces and dimensioned drawings.
When one edge moves, others react accordingly..
Direct seems to be just any nonparametric modeling (like the sculpting mode).


#### renderings
Here's a bike seat, loosely following the tutorial below,
using [saddle images from this page](http://design-real.com/saddle/) and
the cloud rendering feature.  Mm.. bamboo.. comfy.

the board of my car key's remote -- I'm trying to build a new enclosure for the board:
