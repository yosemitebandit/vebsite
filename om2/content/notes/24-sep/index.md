:book: Normal People
- Sally Rooney's novel of relationships, self discovery and inner turmoil -- it was great
- I listened to it on Libby, performed by Aoife McMahon
- I found it very moving in parts
- The podcast _Good Scribes Only_ has a short review,
as does [the NYT](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/08/books/review-normal-people-sally-rooney.html)
which links Rooney's novels to Rachel Cusk's Outline series, and I think I agree with that


:bug: David Hillis's Tree of Life
- in 2003, this UT Austin lab mapped rRNA similarity between ~3k species to produce this graphic;
his original pdf is [here](http://www.zo.utexas.edu/faculty/antisense/DownloadfilesToL.html)

- his description: 
  - "This tree is from an analysis of small subunit rRNA sequences sampled
  from about 3,000 species from throughout the Tree of Life.
  The species were chosen based on their availability,
  but we attempted to include most of the major groups,
  sampled very roughly in proportion to the number of known species in each group
  (although many groups remain over- or under-represented).
  The number of species represented is approximately the square-root of the number of species thought to exist on Earth
  (i.e., three thousand out of an estimated nine million species),
  or about 0.18% of the 1.7 million species that have been formally described and named."
- Wikipedia links some [more recent visualizations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_of_life_(biology)#Horizontal_gene_transfer_and_rooting_the_tree_of_life)
which are equally cool


:snowflake: Quantum Navigation
- I saw [this video from Ben Miles](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFM9HHB9JXI) on creating quantum nav devices,
basically hyper-precise IMUs.
Another source said they were four orders of magnitude more sensitive than traditional IMUs
and thus less susceptible to drift.
- they create a Bose-Einstein condensate (matter near absolute zero)
and then I believe they split the system, it acts as a wave and interferes with itself,
and you can measure some acceleration-dependent patterns.
From there you back out velocity/position.
- This company in the video, [Infleqtion](https://www.infleqtion.com/),
has already done some test flights with the technology, so cool..


:notes: fron2
- [This instrument](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGHIcU3g8Ps) from Fron Reilly is so cool,
bow on rotating strings + resonator, amazing

:city_sunset: Make Sunsets
- article on these guys [in the NYT](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/25/climate/rogue-solar-geoengineering.html) --
they are sort of renegade solar geoengineers, releasing small amounts of sulfur dioxide via balloon
- SO2 forms aerosols which block sunlight. [This stack exchange post](https://earthscience.stackexchange.com/questions/9805/would-adding-sulfur-dioxide-to-the-atmosphere-have-a-global-cooling-effect)
goes into much more detail on the pros/cons of such an idea
- I admire the intent and drive and of course wish they could scale it up responsibly and with more careful study,
but they seem to have a good time launching their one-off balloons .. more power to them
