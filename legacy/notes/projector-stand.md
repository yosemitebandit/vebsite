I was recently given an amazingly tiny 2" cube projector that is surprisingly bright
and battery powered (!?) -- I made this little couch-mount for it.

The projector screen is made of blackout cloth which seems to work well and
was only about $5/yd at Joanne's.
It sits on our bookshelf that's in front of the couch,
and I initially wanted the projected image to be as wide as the shelf.
After some fiddling, I found this meant the projector had to be forward of the couch a bit,
so I put these measurements in fusion to see how large the arm would have to be.

The build came out ok -- you have to /really/ crank down on the wingnuts
to lock the arm's position in place.
It's cantilevered out pretty far.
The mount slides on to the back of the couch --
I made a lot of paper test pieces to figure out the shape
and cut out the pieces on a scroll saw.

The whole thing would be smaller and less prone to wobbling
and just all around less finicky if I could bring the projector
back towards the couch and away from the screen, just to shorten the mount's arm.
This would make the projected image much larger than our bookshelf --
maybe too large -- and we'd need to make a bigger screen.
