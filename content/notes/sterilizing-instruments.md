reading about various ways to clean probes and instruments --
[wikipedia has a great review](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sterilization).

*autoclaving*

* 15-20 min of steam at 121 C, or 134 C for 3-4 min
* performed at high pressure: 100 kPa (which is 1 atm, basically)
* longer cycles for prions
* items have to be physically cleaned beforehand


*dry heat*

* 160 C for 2 hrs or 190 C for 6 min


*flaming, incineration, tyndalization, heated beads*

* heating, burning or boiling water..


*ethylene oxide*

* most common method -- used for ~70% of all sterilizations and over 50% of disposable medical devices
* gas concentrations of 200 - 800 mg/L
* 30-60 C with RH above 30%
* process takes several hours
* kills bacteria, spores, viruses, yeast and other fungi -- also very hazardous to humans
* explosive at concentrations above 3%
* very strict OSHA reqs around EtO's use -- if you can smell it, you've had a hazardous dose
* it can permeate some plastics so you can actually bag your equipment before sterilizing it


*nitrogen dioxide*

* applied at room temp and ambient pressure and "very low concentrations" of the gas
* inactivates spores, bacteria and viruses
* boils at 21 C so people often use liquid NO2 -- often called dinitrogen tetroxide (the dimer)
* less corrosive, no condensation (so the aeration phase is limited)
* still seems like a new technique though, without much commercially-available equipment


*ozone*

* for cleaning surfaces, water and air
* has to be made on-site, typically in the sterilizer itself from medical-grade O2
* easy to remove waste ozone via a catalyst
* dangerous at 5ppm ..way lower than EtO


*glutaraldehyde and formaldehyde*

* 22 hrs+ of immersion
* short shelf lives (<2 weeks) and expensive
  * [$60 / gallon at fishersci](https://www.fishersci.com/shop/products/contec-sporicidin-sterilizing-high-level-disinfecting-solution-3/p-3829034#tab1)
* volatile and toxic to skin contact and inhalation


*hydrogen peroxide*

* sometimes used in vaporized form -- liquid purities are at 35 - 90%
* cycle times as short as 30 min
* listed as dangerous at 75ppm (a tenth of EtO)


*peracetic acid*

* 0.2% purity used as a liquid sterilant


*non-ionizing radiation (UV)*

* 250-260 nm light breaks molecular bonds in a microorganisms DNA
* useful for surfaces (like glass vessels)
* may damage plastics


*ionizing radiation*

* gamma, x-ray, electron beam -- some more penetrating than others
* trivia: meat and DC mail gets irradiated


*summary*

* seems like UV could work well for glass vessels
* EtO could be used for sensitive probes
* autoclave for sturdier probes
