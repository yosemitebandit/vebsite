how to decide what to prototype.. hm, there are many approaches:

<!--more-->

* the [senic blog](https://blog.senic.com/from-idea-to-prototype-d8c8d5c80daa?gi=7bd927b0ef20)
suggests you test even basic assumptions,
and not make anything too high fidelity -- you want to give room for people to discuss their ideas.
  * Also use easy to source / easy to use parts and tools.
  * each proto should have a hypothesis / goal
* [GV folks](http://www.fastcodesign.com/1672929/how-to-decide-what-ideas-to-prototype)
remind you to list all your assumptions,
look for conflict in the ideas as they suggest choices
and to not make the design democratic
* some [YC alums](http://blog.ycombinator.com/advice-for-early-stage-hardware-startups)
recommend a "looks like" high fidelity long term mockup
to go along with a "works like" black box that isn't perfect but accomplishes something
* [Ben of Bolt](https://blog.bolt.io/hardware-by-the-numbers-part-1-team-prototyping-b225a33f55bf)
reminds you to build..one physical model a week
* other reflections:
  * seems wise to list the objectives of the prototype
  * once (on Altman's blog maybe?) I read you should look to test the riskiest bit of your thesis
  * and consider timelines -- what will it mean for testing and validation if you go down a certain route
