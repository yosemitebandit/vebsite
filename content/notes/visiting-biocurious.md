I went to the biocurious space in Sunnyvale
and heard about some cool projects and meetups that they have going on:
bioprinting, bioblock and Real Vegan Cheese (ala [Muufri](http://www.muufri.com/)).

<!--more-->

Also learned about Omnicommons in Oakland -- would be cool to check out,
and the Pembient project out of Indiebio.

learned about the Biomonstaaar bioreactor:

* the [project proposal](http://www.spacegambit.org/files/project_proposals/BioMONSTAAAR.pdf)
links to this [Algae Bioreactor](http://www.inventgeek.com/category/algae/) project
* their [final report](http://www.spacegambit.org/files/reports/BioMONSTAAAR.pdf) links
[iorodeo](http://iorodeo.com/) -- they make some cool lab equipment
* there are several [related instructables](http://www.instructables.com/id/Biomonstaaar/)
for controllers, a UI, monitoring..
* seems to have fallen off though -- their main site is down..
though [this google sites page works](https://sites.google.com/site/biomonstaaar/)
* or [this meetup](http://www.meetup.com/Berkeley-Biolabs/events/165489532/)
says they might still be active in Berkeley

The Sydney biohackerspace is working on a bioreactor, Bionascent might be doing the same.
