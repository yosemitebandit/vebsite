I'd like to build a deck something like this

{{ resize_image(path="projects/backyard-deck/deck-render-one.jpg", width=500, height=500, op="fit_width") }}
{{ resize_image(path="projects/backyard-deck/deck-render-two.jpg", width=500, height=500, op="fit_width") }}

But with railings that turn the corner to the tree.
In fact I'd like to integrate the tree into the railing of the deck.
I'd like it to be free-standing so I don't have to mess with the stucco of the house.
I'm thinking redwood.
I'm thinking hidden fasteners, but not sure about that yet.
I think the PT sub-structure can be built in a modular way,
just so that it's easier to handle the materials.
I like the cable railing

### Main steps
1. draw site plan
1. make major decisions on things like materials, footings
1. make detailed drawing and cutlist; get quotes
1. clear the site
1. posts, beams, joists
1. add decking
1. build stairs
1. add railing
1. stain


### drawing the site plan

### tips
1. ending with a full-width piece of decking:
let the joists run long and calculate the length needed for a full piece of decking,
or potentially even lay all the decking but the last piece, then cut the joists to the right length
