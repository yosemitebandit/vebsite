Some friends and I built targetaccrual.com for the StartX-Med hackathon at Stanford.

It's two frankly separate ideas..
We wanted to build a network graph of researchers for the Rare Cancer Research Foundation
(led by friends that work on the [Chordoma Foundation](http://chordoma.org)).
PubMed was scraped to establish co-authorship networks for various diseases.
See [github](https://github.com/yosemitebandit/crabnet) and the demo for more.

To present a business angle, we got into headhunting for clinical trials.
Many trials fail due to a lack of enrollment and these failures are expensive.
We planned to use scraping systems to inform a custom ad network.
Ads would be targeted to connect doctors, candidates and trials.
