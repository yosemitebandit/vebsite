I saw the Solar Impulse plane land at Moffett Field the other day.
It was at the end of a 60+ hour flight from Hawaii.
We probably watched it land for over an hour -- it's amazingly slow,
only about 30knots!

That rotor blade sound is a helicopter idling behind me..

The pilot, Bertrand Piccard, was in excellent spirits when he emerged from the plane.

It was a very cool sight, and when it was over the crew left in a fleet of Teslas, hah!
