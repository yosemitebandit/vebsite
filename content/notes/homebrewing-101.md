I went to a talk on homebrewing at the Mountain View library.

There are lots of books and online resources about the subject --
here are some small tidbits that caught my attention:

* extract brewing vs full grain brewing:
the former is smaller scale and takes less equipment,
the latter is more extensive, offers more control
* the time at which the hops get added affects the bitterness and floral taste
* SRM is a color scale -- 35+ is a porter, pilsner is like a 2
* IBU is a bitterness scale -- but bitterness can be masked by malt and other flavors,
and the human palate can only distinguish up to about 110 IBUs
according to [this site](https://beerconnoisseur.com/articles/whats-meaning-ibu)
* specialty, no rinse sanitization products exist, and are recommended --
makes cleaning way easier
