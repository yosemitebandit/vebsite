[Hilarious post from @pistacchio](https://medium.com/@pistacchio/i-m-a-web-developer-and-i-ve-been-stuck-with-the-simplest-app-for-the-last-10-days-fb5c50917df#.3pt3hqaf5)
about developing in javascript nowadays --

I'd say I'm in largely the same analysis-paralysis loop
when it comes to upping my js skills.
I guess I'd still go back to React and maybe check out Clojurescript,
but the compiling / testing / packing landscape is quite confusing to me.
