* bonus Dave Chappelle clip..
* probably with the benefit of hindsight,
Dean himself says in the piece that he succumbed to his desire to get people fired up
* before the Iowa caucuses he was around the top of the pack (alongside Kerry, Edwards and Lieberman),
but was slipping a bit because of his temperament -- or the narrative about it
* he gave the famous speech on the night of the Iowa vote,
a vote in which he came in a disappointing third
* other footage from the event shows it was really loud -- there were 3500 people there
* he actually cracks a pretty funny joke about it..
* and most people in the documentary claim that, rather than the scream being his undoing,
it was his coming in third in Iowa that sunk his campaign (he left the race soon after)
