A fantastic, meditative book from Julian Barnes.
This passage is maybe less powerful if you haven’t read it:

> “So, for instance, if Tony ...” These words had a local, textual meaning, specific to forty years ago;
and I might at some point discover that they contained, or led to, a rebuke,
a criticism from my old clear-seeing, self-seeing friend.
But for the moment I heard them with a wider reference -- to the whole of my life.
“So, for instance if Tony ..”
And in this register the words were practically complete in themselves
and didn’t need an explanatory main clause to follow.
Yes indeed, if Tony had seen more clearly, acted more decisively, held to truer moral values,
settled less easily for a passive peaceableness which he first called happiness and later contentment.
If Tony hadn’t been fearful, hadn’t counted on the approval of others for his own self-approval ...
and so on, through a succession of hypotheticals leading to the final one: so, for instance, if Tony hadn’t been Tony.

One of the book’s many musings:

> How often do we tell our own life story? How often do we adjust, embellish, make sly cuts?
And the longer life goes on, the fewer are those around to challenge our account,
to remind us that our life is not our life, merely the story we have told about our life.
Told to others, but – mainly – to ourselves.

The frequent ruminations on memory and on how we construct our history -- these are the best parts.
