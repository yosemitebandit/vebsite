I was recently given a tiny 2" projector that is surprisingly bright
and battery powered (!?) -- I made this little mount for it.

The screen is made of blackout cloth which seems to work well --
it sits on our bookshelf that's in front of the couch
and I initially wanted the projected image to be as wide as the shelf.
After some fiddling, I found this meant the projector had to be forward of the couch a bit,
so I put it in fusion to see how large the arm would have to be.

The build came out ok -- you have to /really/ crank down on the wingnuts
to lock the arm's position in place.
