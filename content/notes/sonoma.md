Nora and I went to Sonoma!
We saw Iron and Wine play at the GunBun winery
and had a nice time touring the Peter Cellars and Ravenswood wineries.

Peter, of Peter Cellars, checking out the crush.
He had award winning Pinots but we liked his Petit Syrah a lot.

We were getting a distinct *Pink Panther* vibe from the this winery (:
