:paperclip: [Classic Papers](https://scholar.googleblog.com/2017/06/classic-papers-articles-that-have-stood.html)
- In 2017 Google Scholar compiled this list of "old" but influential papers:
highly cited but all published in 2006
- A fun project would be to enumerate these classic papers and find open articles or accessible pdfs,
then attempt to find those that are interesting and also accesible to the layman
- e.g. "Maximum entropy modeling of species geographic distributions"
piques my curiosity
but I don't think I'd be able to handle
"Molecular size and weight of asphaltene and asphaltene solubility fractions from coals, crude oils and bitumen"
- The papers could be scored by quantity and "intensity" of jargon
