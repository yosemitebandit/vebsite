Our gate is busted!

{{ resize_image(path="projects/sideyard-gate/original-gate.jpg", width=500, height=500, op="fit_width") }}

The hinges and fasteners aren't quite right on the wooden side.
The hinges might also be mis-aligned.
Also the brace is backwards.
The stucco wall on the left seems to have cinderblock underneath
and the fasteners in there are mostly tight.

The latch is also no good, too easy to get stuck,
and we'd like to be able to open it from the outside, which we currently cannot!


### Designs and Techniques

- probably need to redo the hinges just to feel complete about it
- I'd like to be able to open it from the outside
- should it self-close?
- we'd like to stain it dark to match the front door

Some designs and methods I like:
- my fave: from Julian Hodges, master gate builder
{{ resize_image(path="projects/sideyard-gate/hodges-gate.jpeg", width=500, height=500, op="fit_width") }}
    - https://www.finehomebuilding.com/2007/07/01/in-the-golden-gates-shadow
    - with the recessed slats, curved top, thicker base
    - but how do they curve the top, hmm
    - similar design with rabbet: https://www.youtube.com/shorts/pHctbPSRVhc

    - adjustable hook and band seems really nice [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JiGxM6N3Oo)


### Materials and Design

- I got some lumber and it made me rethink the design, given what was available

{{ resize_image(path="projects/sideyard-gate/frame.jpg", width=500, height=500, op="fit_width") }}

- I'll try a redwood frame, with thin redwood slats to cover the front, and complete an arch
- I think I'll need some slat pattern that will be more cut efficient,
diagonal or could this work with an arch at top, hm:

{{ resize_image(path="projects/sideyard-gate/atd-gates-la.jpeg", width=500, height=500, op="fit_width") }}

- could mimic a deck hidden fastener system and use knock-off deck clips like "Muzata" or "Myard" on Amazon..
of course you'd have to cut some dados in your boards
- or could make a nice face-nailing pattern, following the arch, pre-drilling for stainless nails
- could put in trim screws and fill them,
or could glue a decorative curved piece of trim on top of that screw pattern to hide it
