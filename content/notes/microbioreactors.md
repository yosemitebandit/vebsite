I've been reading [this 2013 thesis on microbioreactors](/misc/goh-microbioreactor-design.pdf),
published by Shireen Goh as her PhD work at MIT.
More interesting papers are linked [here](http://www.rle.mit.edu/sclaser/major-research-themes/integrated-biosystems-and-biosensing/).

A paper on the [TAP Sonata in the Journal of Lab Automation](http://jla.sagepub.com/content/13/3/145.full) --
it's an automated shake flask handler:

* six processing modules: liquid handling, shaking, incubation, chilled i/o carousel, centrifuge and cell counter
* six-axis RX60L robotic arm from St√§ubli
* holds 40 microtiter plates, 245 250mL flasks
