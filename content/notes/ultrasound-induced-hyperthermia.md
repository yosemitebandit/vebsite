+++

I worked on ultrasound-induced hyperthermia as a senior at NCSSM --
it was a great taste of self-guided research.
My project was to build a small apparatus
that could heat something on the order of 100mL of water,
and to predict the rate of heating based on the physical parameters of the setup.

Hyperthermia was thought to be an adjuvant treatment for some cancers --
the heating you could achieve would aid in blood perfusion for better uptake of chemotherapies
or could be used to activate certain chemo drugs in a region of the body.
