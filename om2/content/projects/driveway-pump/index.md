It's been wet lately!

We have water collect in the backyard, especially after several days of rain.

Currently there's a small sump pump
([this one - Wayne EEAUP250](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00502AIUU))
installed about a foot below the driveway.
Water moves from the NE side of the backyard, 
under the gate, to the driveway near the garage.
Then a little cement channel directs the water to a small basin dug out in the driveway.
The pump's in the basin and that pushes water towards the street
via PVC pipe laid under the driveway.

Clay soil, wish I didn't have to pump it out but I think I do.
It's definitely better than it was when we moved in --
we made the backyard more permeable..but it can still saturate.


### Things to make better
- drainage for the other corner of the yard
- try to install a check valve..again..
last time the pump seemingly couldn't push the valve open
- drain to street-side of sidewalk with angle vs just bubbling up
- better electrical connection to the pump + switching
- deeper and larger pump basin
- better basin cover

Main issue now is the pump is just plugged into an outdoor outlet,
and I don't like to let it run all the time due to the lack of a working check valve.
So I go to manually plug/unplug it during storms.
The outlet is GFCI but it's falling apart :/ 


### Options
Could I reinstall the outlet with a better cover?
Add a manual outdoor switch? Or a wireless one?
Could I wire it all in the crawlspace instead?
I would be satisfied with a waterproof cover and manual weather-rated switch.


### Reading/watching
- some good tips [here](https://forum.universal-devices.com/topic/21126-outdoor-sump-pump-what-would-you-do/)
- I like [this fellow's video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywgDOSHvsIg);
nice tip to use a flexible coupling near the pump outlet to relieve stress on those connections
- [video on a full drainage system](https://www.homedepot.com/p/NDS-Pop-Up-Drainage-Emitter-with-Elbow-for-3-in-Drain-Pipes-Green-Plastic-322G/100164533#overlay)
including a "dry well", which is like a big deep basin full of stones, deep in the ground,
where water can collect and presumably enter into the ground
