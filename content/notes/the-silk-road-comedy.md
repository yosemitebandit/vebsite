Perhaps still in Serial withdrawal, I've been reading a little bit about the Silk Road trial against Ulbricht.
The guy tried to order [six (!) hits](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-12-10/silk-road-s-ulbricht-accused-of-six-murder-for-hire-plots.html)
on people who scammed SR users, threatened to expose SR users or worked with federal agents.
(Well it was DPR ordering hits, presumption of innocence, ok..).
When the Hells Angels hitman couldn't get to Friendly Chemist alone,
DPR haggled a bit on the cost of having FC and everybody else in the vicinity killed in one fell swoop.
What a lunatic.

I love hubris -- it seems like DPR was himself scammed,
probably at least twice, in his quest for drug dealer justice.
The execution of his former staffer, Flush, was faked by the FBI,
and another hit, one that Ulbricht marked as confirmed in [his diary](http://www.wired.com/2015/01/heres-secret-silk-road-journal-laptop-ross-ulbricht/),
never matched any local deaths and was also likely faked..

More data:

* Ulbricht's [spreadsheet on the SR business](https://www.dropbox.com/s/f94v4d4c8hs8vcw/253456480-Silk-Road-exhibits-GX-250.pdf)
* the FBI's [stats on their undercover SR buys](https://twitter.com/a_greenberg/status/555429280319303681): 48/50 successful from 40 dealers in 10 countries
* tons of info compiled on [antilop.cc](http://antilop.cc/sr/) (scrapes, timelines, user histories..geez)
* and the 'mastermind' tab found open on Ulbricht's laptop (the transaction numbers are maybe monthly?
I don't really have a good sense of how much money SR made or how many buyers there were):

How they found Ulbricht, I had read it was from this
[SO post](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/15445285).
But [this ars article](http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2015/01/the-incredibly-simple-story-of-how-the-govt-googled-ross-ulbricht/)
says it was through an IRS agent's googling which led to another forum and subpoenaing Ulbricht's gmail account.

Also fascinating was the amateur investigation into the FBI's mole, eventually confirmed by trial testimony.
Apparently Ulbricht was [IMing a core SR member, cirrus](http://www.wired.com/2015/01/silk-road-trial-undercover-dhs-fbi-trap-ross-ulbricht/)
at the time of his arrest.
Cirrus, aka scout was an account that had been run by the FBI since 2013.
In that wired article, the agent claims he got Ulbricht logged into SR as DPR during the chat as part of the setup for the arrest.

Ulbricht's open laptop led to a lot of other arrests of SR core members
and other folks, including this guy [trying to buy ricin](http://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/new-york-man-indicted-attempting-acquire-deadly-toxin-ricin), jesus..
By the way, these arrests were possible because Ulbricht made his core team dox themselves (amazing..),
so after the FBI's visit to the Glen Park PL, Ulbricht's "Staff" folder was a few clicks away..

The trainwreck continued when SR2 imploded months after it began..
I think there was a massive "hack" that was probably just an internal theft of many BTC.
Then followed more arrests -- they had been infiltrated since day one,
also by the cirrus fellow, I believe.

A lot of this is sad -- especially the alleged murder-for-hire stuff.
But it is fun to see an amateur kingpin cum web dev hoisted by his own petard in very public fashion..

*Sept 15 2015 update*

Just read [this Mar 31 article on Forbes](http://www.forbes.com/sites/sarahjeong/2015/03/31/force-and-bridges/)
about the DEA agent Carl Mark Force and the Secret Service agent Shaun Bridges.
They orchestrated the fake hit ordered by DPR.
And Force allegedly extorted DPR for bitcoin
by selling off information from inside the federal investigation into Silk Road.
Force made ~$1M off from these efforts.
He also used his DEA authority to do background checks on behalf of CoinMKT, another exchange.

Force got into trouble though when he started using his badge
to clear up personal issues with Venmo and Coinstamp -- they got suspicious and reported him.
There are also screenshots of some interesting emails between Karpeles and Force --
Force trying to offload 250 BTC, then looking for a job at Mt Gox
and then needling Karpeles when his exchange was raided.
The information about Force and Bridges' actions wasn't raised in the Ulbricht trial.
The judge explicitly declared it not exculpatory.
The government says that agents Force and Bridges
had gained admin access to Silk Road (through Curtis Clark Green),
but they used that access in ilicit ways about which the government had no knowledge.
