* ran through the loopgifs demo from the video
* it was cool to use js in a much more structured way (and in a functional style)
* modules and some of the tools are both nice, though I still had weird node / npm install issues
..confusion I remember having years ago
* nice to be exposed to some of the new es6 features like arrow functions and classes
* also semicolons..I didn't type a single one, whoa, what happened there?
