[Holodomor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holodomor):
a man-made famine in Ukraine that killed 2-7M people in 1932 and 33

* unbelievable, I'd never heard of this..
* it seems largely accepted that Soviet Union policies intentionally
created famine, possibly to suppress Ukranian nationalism
* the food supply was mismanaged in various ways,
and the farm output in those years was lower
because the First Five Year Plan mandated
the growing of sugar beets and cotton, rather than the sowing of grain.

[The Intercept on The Red Web](https://theintercept.com/2015/09/08/how-putin-controls-the-russian-internet/?comments=1#comments),
a book on Internet surveillance and censorship in Russia

* engineering 'specialists' in the country need very little persuasion
to develop tools to help in surveillance -- "a decent salary
combined with the opportunity to practice oneâ€™s trade was often enough."
Not that that's different outside of Russia..
* media groups and other organizations kowtow to government demands,
hoping to do enough to keep their company alive,
but they often give away too much
* the author of the article points out that the book
suffers from having being written within this system --
it's hard for the authors to develop a complete picture of this system
because they themselves exist within it
