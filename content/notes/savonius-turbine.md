I worked for the 'turbine research group'
in a contest to create a wind-powered, mechanical energy-only, desalination prototype.
We built some variants on the the savonius vertical-axis design
to test the effects of different geometries.
Our team eventually took 'most-innovative' at the
[WERC contest](http://www.ieenmsu.com/events/design-contest/past-years/2009-2).

See some notes about what we were up to are [here](http://wiki.duke.edu/display/wtw/energy+capture).
