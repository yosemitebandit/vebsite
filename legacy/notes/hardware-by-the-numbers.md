notes on bolt's "Hardware by the Numbers" series on hw startups:

<!--more-->


### [part one -- team + prototyping](https://blog.bolt.io/hardware-by-the-numbers-part-1-team-prototyping-b225a33f55bf)
* in the founding team, need a hacker and a dealmaker / hustler
  * to scale need 8 employees: ME + EE + FW + ID/UX, FE + BE, Marketing/Sales + Ops
  * a 50-50 split of equity is rare -- usually someone brings a little more to the table --
  lots of other equity advice.. option pools too.. tax advice..
* prototyping: typically takes at least six months in core product dev
from ideation through final, functional prototype
  * build something new (something physical) every week..not necessarily functional,
  but something to test a feature or the look/feel of something
* get solid relationships with 30 customers at least to get relevant, statistically significant feedback
* initially, don't stress about patents


### [part two -- financing and manufacturing](https://blog.bolt.io/hardware-by-the-numbers-part-2-financing-manufacturing-474c7efe6c5f)
* a VC leading a financing round will want to own 20%
  * VCs will want you to be an outlier -- getting to $100M in revenue in a few years
  * mean pre-money valuation is $4.5M for priced seed rounds (east coast startups, btw) --
  but the interest / quality of the investor is more important than the valuation
* average companies do four rounds..so try to sell under 25% of the company in each round
* companies get commits from 10% of investors they ask -- try to pitch in tranches of five
* average hardware crowdfunded campaign raises only $92k
* target 18 months of runway -- and know it takes 3-6 months to fundraise,
and you want to either be fundraising or focusing on product, not both
* in first year of production, a CM wants to see $1M of BOM leaving the factory --
and they will want that figure to accelerate
  * it can take 3 months to finalize negotiations with a CM
  * typically you'll be quoted 180days for a CM to do its work, but it often stretches into 1yr territory
  * optimize your specialized parts but let the CM find the cheapest SMD resistors..
  they're better at it than you
  * injection molds are like $6.5k each and you'll porbably have 5-50 different molded parts --
  it's 2x more expensive in the US, takes 2x longer, and can't be later shipped to China
  because tooling standards are different
* certifications -- you'll probably need at least one and it'll cost about $15k
* think about packaging..it doesn't have to be expensive, but it's not free


### [part three -- logistics and marketing](https://blog.bolt.io/hardware-by-the-numbers-part-3-logistics-marketing-1c7f37b64c05)
* recommends buying insurance on your container ships --
they can fall overboard :o and it's a 4-5wk journey
  * $2.1k to move a single container across the pacific
  * air freight is 10x the cost
* 3-5% of the BOM is paid in customs fees
* expect to pay 2-5% of the BOM on logistics providers
  * moving a pallet from CA to NY is $1k and takes 4-5 days
* expect 10% return rate -- and realize that handling this is expensive
* recommends just giving 10 units away per week for a $50 COGS product --
more effective than a PR firm, he argues
* a full day photo shoot with a pro photographer is $3-5k but adds a lot
  * most launch videos cost $7k
* expect only 2 / 100 web visitors to purchase a product online,
brick and mortar stores are critical


### [part four -- retail + exits](https://blog.bolt.io/hardware-by-the-numbers-part-4-retail-exits-7b5e68cbd54a)
* online retailers take 15-20% of the final sale price
  * big box or specialty retailers are far higher 40-70% --
  the apple store, for instance, takes about 50%
* licensing will only make you 5% MSRP or 2%, more likely
* look for recurring revenue opportunities..
* average successfully exited, VC backed company takes 6yrs, $42M raised and goes for $242M
* 2/3 founders make under $10M after an exit (and taxes)
